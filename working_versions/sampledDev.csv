That was one of the issues on the table when U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, and former state police Col. Brendan Doherty, a Republican, squared off in a WPRI - Providence Journal debate Oct. 16. Doherty talked about a bill he supports that would raise revenue for infrastructure by allowing more oil and gas drilling on federally-owned lands. Cicilline called it ""a big, big giveaway to big oil . . . when we already know, according to the best available data as of February of this year, there are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined."" More oil rigs in operation than everyone else in the world? That's quite a statistic. We wondered if it is true. This is a talking point that has been used in the past by the Obama administration. In fact, when we asked the Cicilline campaign for the source of the factoid, they sent us to a blog entry at the White House website that stated it without giving a source or offering any numbers. PolitiFact Florida looked at the claim (and a related claim) this winter, when President Obama offered it in February during speeches in Miami and earlier in New Hampshire. They found that the answer wasn't quite so simple. The U.S. Energy Information Administration recommended that PolitiFact get the latest count from Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company. We checked the numbers from two weeks ago. (For even more recent numbers, go here.) As of Oct. 12, 2012, the company had tallied 1,835 oil and gas drilling rigs in the United States and 1,615 in other countries. (That U.S. number is 188 lower than the 2011 total. The international number is 71 rigs higher.) However, the Baker Hughes data do not include rigs drilling in Russia or onshore China because those statistics are difficult to get. Richard Mason, who works for the publication Hart Energy Digital, told PolitiFact in February that ""the last numbers I saw out of Russia, which are 18 months old, had more than 1,000 rigs active."" Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, another energy publication, cited a report from a Chinese state-owned company that manufactures rigs and rig equipment that showed more than 1,000 land rigs. As Cicilline’s statement stood, only 221 more international rigs were need to make it False. And the Baker Hughes count is probably missing the approximately 2,000 rigs in Russia and China. And all that was applicable in February. Our ruling David Cicilline said, ""There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined."" He said that information comes from ""the best available data"" in February. He's relying on a count that excludes some of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, calling that the ""best available data."" It's not. The best available data would take into account reliable evidence that two thousand rigs are in operation in China and Russia, a number that would allow the world total to overwhelm the U.S. total. Just because you haven't counted something, doesn't mean it's not there. For that reason, we rate Cicilline's claim False. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

123,pomt-13792,"Says Hillary Clinton is proposing ""destroying Medicare for seniors.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-wrong-hillary-clinton-proposing-de/,"Speaking at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Donald Trump Jr. touted his father, the newly anointed GOP presidential nominee, as someone who would be able to do a better job on health care than his rival, Hillary Clinton. He said his father would be ""a president who will repeal and replace Obamacare without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care, and who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors, as Hillary Clinton has proposed."" Given how popular the single-payer health care program for seniors is, it was pretty obvious to us that Clinton wouldn’t have put the proposal ""destroy Medicare"" on the issues page of her website. (We were right on that one.) Still, we wondered whether there is any plausible interpretation of her actual Medicare policy proposals in which they could end up ""destroying Medicare for seniors."" We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign about what Donald Trump Jr. meant, but we took a look for ourselves. First, let’s review Clinton’s agenda for Medicare. On her issues page, the word ""Medicare"" comes up twice. First, Clinton said she would ""explore cost-effective ways to make more health care providers eligible for telehealth reimbursement under Medicare and other programs."" That’s a fairly limited program, as well as relatively non-controversial and unlikely -- even in a worst-case scenario -- to endanger the program’s future, said Sherry Glied, a health policy specialist at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. The second reference to Medicare on Clinton’s issue page is more sweeping -- to ""support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare."" Currently, you need to be 65 to get coverage under Medicare. Under Clinton’s proposal, people up to 10 years younger than that could sign up for the program if they wanted to. Health care experts told PolitiFact that this proposal comes with challenges, but that even if worst came to worst, the idea seems unlikely to jeopardize the program’s continued existence for its core membership of those 65 and older. ""There have been lots of proposals of this type in past and not much concern about the effects on traditional Medicare, assuming premiums are set correctly,"" Glied said. She said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last analyzed a proposal of this sort in December 2008 and ""raised no concerns about effects on the program as a whole."" A. Bowen Garrett, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s health policy center, agreed that the eventual fine print in Clinton’s proposal is going to matter, because in any program that’s optional, there’s a risk that it could attract a relatively small and less healthy pool of beneficiaries who could force premiums upward. Still, Garrett said, ""I do not see why that would necessarily harm the program"" in the way Donald Trump Jr. meant it. Indeed, in the fight to craft the Democratic platform, Clinton’s allies managed to defeat a more sweeping proposal backed by Bernie Sanders to cover all Americans through a Medicare-style single-payer system. After the proposal was defeated, several experts -- including some who are sympathetic to the idea of expanding health insurance coverage -- told Kaiser Health News that the Sanders approach that Clinton defeated was disruptive enough to have actually put the program at risk. ""It’s hard to be nimble"" when a system gets that big, Ezekiel Emanuel, who advised Obama on crafting his signature health care law, told the publication. ""No organization in the world does anything for 300 million people and does it efficiently."" Princeton University health policy expert Paul Starr, a onetime adviser to President Bill Clinton, concurred that ""to try to do it in one fell swoop would be massively disruptive,"" according to Kaiser Health News. Other health care specialists told PolitiFact that Donald Trump Jr.’s statement is vastly overheated. ""There is nothing in her proposals that would destroy Medicare or harm present or future beneficiaries,"" said John Rother, the president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care and the former executive vice president for policy at AARP -- the seniors’ group that would presumably be at most direct risk if Medicare collapsed. Clinton is urging ""changes, yes, quite a few. But nothing that would harm the program or those it serves."" Rena M. Conti, a health policy specialist at the University of Chicago, agreed. ""Nothing I am aware her saying to date would imply that she aims to dismantle the current Medicare program or take away benefits that seniors currently enjoy or bankrupt the trust fund that is used to finance some current Medicare benefits for seniors,"" she said. Our ruling Donald Trump Jr. said Clinton is proposing ""destroying Medicare for seniors."" Clinton is certainly not proposing that in a literal sense, and experts we contacted agreed that her actual policy proposals -- especially making Medicare an option for those between 55 and 65 -- were ambitious but were hardly a dagger at the heart of the program.

124,pomt-09230,"Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues.",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/13/mary-landrieu/landrieu-says-louisiana-doesnt-get-one-single-penn/,"In the wake of the BP oil leak disaster, offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has come under intense scrutiny. On May 11, 2010, as Congress held hearings on the incident, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. -- whose state has so far been most directly threatened by the slick -- discussed the issue with MSNBC's Ed Schultz. Landrieu, who has often been an advocate for the energy industry in the Senate, told the liberal talk show host, ""I can promise you, no one's going to let the industry skid. We're going to make BP pay. And, I might say, and you know because you've heard me say this before, when will America realize that the Gulf Coast states need revenue-sharing? Do you know how much money the federal treasury gets from this industry every year? An average of $5 billion. Do you know how much money Louisiana gets? Not one single penny."" Landrieu's statement was so forceful -- that Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" -- that we thought it deserved a fact-check. Before we get to that question, let's first look to see if she was correct about the federal treasury's take. It turns out that Landrieu is basically right. For 2009, the Minerals Management Service -- the office in the Interior Department that collects revenues from energy production -- sent $5.7 billion directly to the federal treasury. But is the Louisiana share of offshore oil royalties really zero, as Landrieu suggested? It's a bit complicated, but the truth is the state makes millions. Here's the breakdown: • For the first 3 miles out from the shoreline, Louisiana -- like other states -- gets to keep 100 percent of any royalties produced by oil and gas drilling. In the most recent year available, 2008, this amounted to $275 million. • Between 3 and 6 miles from the shoreline -- a federally owned band formally known as the 8(g) area -- the federal government sends 27 percent of the royalties to Louisiana. The reasoning is that federal drilling in this area sucks out some of the oil from deposits that span the 3-mile dividing line between state and federal ownership, so these payments are meant to compensate for the lost revenue to states. In 2009, they totaled $22 million and they're estimated to be $32 million this year. • Beyond 6 miles from the shoreline is considered federal territory. For new drilling projects, states get a 37.5 percent share directly to their treasuries and an additional 12.5 percent for state land and water conservation fund projects. The 37.5 percent figure alone amounted to $6.3 million for Louisiana's treasury in 2009, with additional estimated amounts of $558,000 in 2010 and $476,000 in 2011. Existing drilling projects do not currently provide royalties to the states -- a sore point for Louisianans. (More on that later.) And some bonus money that's an indirect result of oil and gas operations off its shores: Louisiana gets a share of the Coastal Impact Assistance Program, a federal program funded by a one-time appropriation of $1 billion distributed between from 2007 to 2010. This money is dispersed to Gulf Coast states, except for Florida, in an amount roughly proportional to the amount of offshore production in federal waters off their shores. Through this program, Louisiana has taken in a share of the $1 billion appropriation. The grand total that Louisiana receives in a typical year is difficult to compute because of big variations in oil prices and other factors, but we feel safe in saying it's in the tens of millions of dollars every year, and depending on how you slice the numbers, possibly hundreds of millions of dollars. Either way, it's not accurate to say that Louisiana received ""not one single penny,"" as Landrieu did. (We ran our findings by both Landrieu's office and by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and they agreed that our reporting was accurate.) So what's behind Landrieu's claim? She has long argued that the state gets far less than it deserves from the proceeds of offshore drilling. Before passage of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 -- a bill that Landrieu championed -- Louisiana indeed got no financial benefit from federal wells further than 6 miles from its shores. And even that bill didn't go nearly as far as Landrieu wanted. Because only revenues from new projects are included initially, the payments to Louisiana will be relatively modest through 2017 -- a year outside the ""budget window,"" which is a common trick for lawmakers to make bills seem less expensive than they actually are. After that, the payments get quite large, as royalties from existing projects kick in. Louisiana could reap some of an estimated $385 million in 2017 and a share of up to $630 million in later years. Not seeing those big amounts materialize sooner has been a continued source of irritation for many Louisianans, including Landrieu. Reasonable people can disagree over how much Louisiana deserves to receive from drilling off its shores, but even if Landrieu has a point that her state is getting a raw deal over royalties, it is clearly incorrect for her to say that the state gets ""not one single penny"" from offshore drilling.

That’s especially true because, despite a 6-year-old order from the state Department of Natural Resources to either repair or replace the 80-year-old structure, and a circuit court order declaring the dam a nuisance, the issue has not been resolved. County Executive Chris Abele wants to tear the dam down, but the County Board has voted to repair the structure. When Abele challenger Chris Larson was on the board, he voted to repair the dam, but now says he’s willing to consider removing it because public sentiment seems to have changed. But Larson, a state senator, also has been sharply critical of Abele’s leadership on the issue. Both are Democrats running for the nonpartisan office in the April 5, 2016 election. Abele ""has had five years and he’s done nothing"" about the dam, Larson said during a March 29, 2016 appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club. That echoed what he wrote in a March 15, 2016 email to supporters: ""The current county executive has provided no leadership in forging a consensus on what to do with the dam, he has no urgency in addressing this problem."" Is Larson correct that Abele has ""done nothing"" on the matter? The options There are two major alternatives before county officials. Removal: The Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups, has urged the removal of the dam. They note that the removal of the North Avenue Dam, a few miles downstream, led to improved water quality and a thriving fish and wildlife population. Advocates also argue the Estabrook Dam primarily benefits a small number of property owners who enjoy the impoundment, or lake, that the dam creates. They say that is unfair -- even illegal -- because a public facility is creating benefits for a few private property owners. Repair: The Milwaukee River Preservation Association, a group that includes riverfront property owners, and others, including County Board Chairman Theo Lipscomb, favor repairing the dam. They argue the dam creates an important water recreational area and say its removal could lead to the release of toxins built up behind the structure over the decades. Under orders by the federal government, the county hired a consultant, AECOM, to conduct an environmental assessment of the dam. The $250,000 report, released in early 2015, did not recommend an option. But it did note public sentiment at meetings held in September 2014 was about 2-to-1 in favor of removal and said that over time it would cost twice as much to repair and continue operating the dam than it would be to remove it. The report also cited the environmental benefits to allowing water to flow freely and called removal the most ""environmentally protective alternative."" The report was conducted during Abele’s tenure, under orders from the federal government, because it was believed, at the time, that the feds owned an island that is connected to the dam. Abele’s tenure There’s considerable disagreement between Abele and some members of the County Board -- especially Lipscomb, who represents the area -- over how to address the dam. If you had to describe Abele’s record on the dam in one word, it would be ""hamstrung."" On at least two occasions involving the 2015 budget, Lipscomb succeed in getting the board to insert money into the county budget -- first to repair the dam and later to build a fish passage, which is a component of one of the rebuilding options. Abele vetoed both, with one overridden and one sustained. In between the votes and vetoes, Abele’s parks department sent a memo to the board urging it to take action and noting the board itself had changed its position from remove to replace several times. Abele also sent the board a resolution to remove the dam, noting that repairs had become increasingly expensive. And Abele’s chief of staff, Raisa Koltun, followed up with several emails to Lipscomb, but the matter was never scheduled for a vote. Beyond the stalemate with the County Board, Koltun said Abele has worked to forge a consensus with local units of government that have an interest in the dam, including the city of Milwaukee, villages of Shorewood and Brown Deer and the Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewerage District. He has also worked with groups like the Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited and the Milwaukee Riverkeeper, as well as pursued private and federal funding to help pay for the dam’s removal. Our rating Larson says Abele has had five years in office and ""done nothing"" about the Estabrook Dam, with an earlier statement blaming him for a lack of consensus. But records and news accounts show Abele has been consistent in wanting the dam removed, has taken steps to make his wishes known and to build support for removal among nearby communities and other groups. Along the way, he has been thwarted by the County Board. Larson’s statement was that Abele has done nothing.

126,pomt-07444,"""For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion.""",false,/ohio/statements/2011/apr/21/jean-schmidt/rep-jean-schmidt-says-32-every-33-pregnant-women-w/,"Soon after taking control of the House of Representatives, Republicans opened a new front in the abortion war by attempting to block Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal money. Federal law already prohibits tax dollars from paying for abortions, but Republicans argue that the $363 million that Planned Parenthood gets each year for Title X family planning services actually subsidizes abortions indirectly because money is fungible. The April 14 measure that would have stripped federal funds from Planned Parenthood passed the House by a 241-185 margin but failed in a 42-58 U.S. Senate vote. During debate over the bill, Democrats portrayed Planned Parenthood clinics as a major provider of many types of health services to low income women, while Republicans claimed that Planned Parenthood steers pregnant women into getting abortions. ""For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion,"" Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Cincinnati-area Republican, said in a speech in the House of Representatives. That ratio got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. So we asked her office where the numbers came from. Schmidt was president of Right-to-Life of Greater Cincinnati before she was elected to Congress and currently chairs the House Pro-Life Women’s Caucus. She referred us to reports produced by several anti-abortion organizations, including Americans United for Life, Concerned Women for America, Liberty Counsel Action, Family Research Council Action, and the Chiaroscuro Foundation. All stated that roughly 98 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services to pregnant women consist of abortion. They derived their information from a March 2011 fact sheet from Planned Parenthood. That fact sheet says the group performed 332,278 abortions in 2009, referred 977 patients to other agencies for adoptions, and provided prenatal care to 7,021 patients. The anti-abortion groups came up with the 98 percent figure by comparing the number of abortions to the number of procedures in the other two categories. Schmidt’s 32 out of 33 statistic works out to 97 percent - the approximate percentage her sources provided. But there are problems with that calculation. First, it assumes that pregnant women only go to Planned Parenthood for one of those three options. Planned Parenthood representatives say that interpretation overstates the ratio of abortions among its pregnant clients. It ignores other statistics, such as the 1,158,924 pregnancy tests the group provided, and the fact that those 332,278 abortions were just 3 percent of the 11,383,900 total procedures that Planned Parenthood health centers provided that year to its 3 million patients. Thirty five percent of its services consisted of providing contraception and another 35 percent consisted of testing for sexually transmitted diseases and treatment. The fact sheet stats also don’t reflect the fact that only a tiny proportion of Planned Parenthood centers around the country provide prenatal care - just 63 out of more than 800, said Tait Sye, a spokesman for the organization. Those that don’t offer prenatal care refer pregnant women to other health care providers for those services, and Planned Parenthood doesn’t keep track of those referrals. And the 7,021 figure for prenatal clients that was used in the calculations doesn’t include pregnant women who went to Planned Parenthood for prenatal care and were sent to outside obstetricians. The group doesn’t ""ask the pregnancy status of every woman that walks into Planned Parenthood,"" and plenty of pregnant women use the organization for other services, like breast exams, Sye said. Consequently, he says it’s ""impossible to calculate an accurate percentage if you don’t know the total number of pregnant women it is based on."" In an emailed statement, Planned Parenthood Vice President for Communications Stuart Schear called Schmidt’s assertion ""a meaningless and unverifiable statistic since Planned Parenthood does not collect information on the pregnancy status of every female patient who comes into our health centers."" When Schmidt was asked about the points made by Planned Parenthood’s spokesmen, she said the group ""obfuscates the truth by comparing apples to oranges – or services to patients."" ""They say 90 percent of the services they provide are preventative, but more than 10 percent of their patients are provided an abortion,"" Schmidt said in an email. ""They say they don't know the number of pregnant women they serve. It shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Whether a patient is pregnant or not should be one of the first questions they ask."" Schmidt is correct that women of childbearing age are routinely asked whether they might be pregnant when they visit a doctor’s office. Sye acknowledged that Planned Parenthood’s intake form contains a question that asks whether female patients are pregnant. ""But, we don’t tally the number of women we see every year who are pregnant or not pregnant,"" he said. PolitiFact recently fact checked a statement Sen. John Kyl made about Planned Parenthood. In that item we noted a few caveats that are worth repeating. First, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of ""services"" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. So Schmidt does have a point about citing services, rather than patient numbers. Second, it’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith. What certainly is true is that without knowing the total number of pregnant women that Planned Parenthood sees, it is impossible to compute an accurate ratio for how many of them get abortions. PolitiFact places the burden of proof on the speaker. In this case, Schmidt cannot meet that burden because information needed for that showing is unknown. Anti-abortion groups and Schmidt can try to fill the information vacuum by using Planned Parenthood’s incomplete data to come up with their own number. But that doesn’t mean that their number is correct. The fact sheet shows that Planned Parenthood does a sizable number of abortions. But the ratio she cites (97 percent) is extreme. Sye noted that just 63 out of more than 800 Planned Parenthood centers provide their own prenatal care. That means that pregnant women seeking prenatal care from more than 700 centers would be referred to outside providers. Women seeking prenatal care are not likely to be seeking an abortion, and none of those women are included in the totals cited by Schmidt’s sources. Schmidt’s claim also overlooks that pregnant women who ""walk into"" a clinic could be there for any reason, not just for pregnancy-related services. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Schmidt’s statement False. Comment on this item.",None,Jean Schmidt,None,None,None,2011-04-21T06:00:00,2011-04-14,['None']
127,pomt-00793,"""You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire (at school)? Zero.""",false,/florida/statements/2015/apr/06/greg-steube/debate-school-gun-bill-legislator-says-there-have-/,"By next school year, some school workers may be allowed to pack heat. A bill that has received approval by some legislative panels would allow superintendents to designate certain K-12 employees to carry concealed firearms. State Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, a sponsor of the bill, said the measure makes a lot of sense considering school shootings of recent years. Here’s what he said during a Florida House judiciary committee hearing April 2: ""Right now our schools are required to do two or three fire drills a year. You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire? Zero. You know how many have died because of a school shooting? Quite a few, but the state doesn’t require them to do any type of training. So this would require them to do, every year two times, school safety training as it relates to active shooters to work out these type of details that need to be worked out."" The committee voted in favor of the bill -- as did two other House panels in March. We were alerted to Steube’s statement about the lack of fatal school fires by Associated Press reporter Gary Fineout who tweeted about it. So we decided to check it out. Data on school fires Steube told PolitiFact Florida that he ""definitely misspoke"" about school fires. ""I was talking about Florida,"" said Steube, who first proposed such legislation in 2013 after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ""There has never been in the history of Florida a child who died in a school fire."" Steube said the point he was trying to make is that Florida schools are required to do fire drills, but not lockdown drills. (Staff analysis of the bill states that schools must develop procedures for hostage and weapons situations; Steube’s bill inserts language that requires schools to do drills for active shooter/hostage situations.) Some school districts already do lockdown drills including in Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade Pasco and Pinellas counties. We drew information about fatal school fires from the National Fire Protection Association. The association lists school fires with 10 or more deaths. Most of the fires go back to the first half of the 20th century. We will summarize a few of the fires: Consolidated School in New London, Texas: This school fire has the largest number of fatalities documented by the association. A gas explosion in March 18, 1937, led to the deaths of 294 students and teachers at the school which was next to an oil refinery. A teacher turned on a sanding machine in an area filled with a mixture of gas and air, which set off the fire. ""Immediately the building seemed to lift in the air and then smashed to the ground. Walls collapsed. The roof fell in and buried its victims in a mass of brick, steel, and concrete debris,"" states history from a museum that memorializes the fire. Lakeview School in Collinwood, Ohio: A suburban Cleveland elementary school caught fire and killed 173 children and three adults on March 4, 1908. A furnace set fire to wooden supports, and the conflagration quickly spread throughout the building. Our Lady of the Angels school, Chicago: On Dec. 1 , 1958, fire broke out at the foot of a stairway in the school, killing 90 pupils and three nuns. A student smoking might have been the cause. Thankfully, those types of fires are no longer common due to modern safety standards. ""In recent years, the very few deaths that do occur in schools tend to be either adults or juvenile firesetters who set a fire in the school,"" said Marty Ahrens, who works for the association. In recent decades, the association has collected fire data through the federal government’s National Fire Incident Reporting System and its own survey. Between 2007-11, U.S. fire departments responded to an estimated average of 5,690 structure fires in educational properties including day cares, K-12 schools and colleges. These fires caused an annual average of 85 civilian fire injuries and $92 million in direct property damage. In search of fires at schools in Florida Since Steube told us that he meant to say there had been no children who died in fires at Florida schools, we asked state experts if they could recall any. A spokeswoman for the state fire marshal said there were no fire-related fatalities in K-12 schools between 2000 and 2014, which includes all available incidents in the fire marshal’s database. We did find a case of a 4-year-old girl dying in a fire at a day care center in Tallahassee. A malfunctioning fan caused a fire at Stepping Stones child care center in Tallahassee in 2008. The day before the fire, a problem with a bathroom exhaust fan was noted on a repair sheet. A ""floater"" teacher assigned to the girl and her class that day had not yet been trained on what to do in a fire and was scheduled to be trained that day, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. We also found records of a dormitory fire in 1914 that killed six children and two staff members at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, the infamous reform school in Marianna (although that was a penal institution and not a traditional school). The school’s superintendent and staff were on a ""pleasure bent"" in town when the fire started. The superintendent was dismissed after facts were presented to a grand jury. The school was shut down in 2011 after a bleak history full of rape, torture and unreported child deaths. Our ruling When talking about a bill to designate certain people in K-12 schools to carry firearms, Steube said ""You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire (at school)? Zero."" There have been at least eight school fires with 10 or more deaths in the United States, though the most recent one was in 1958, according to a national association that tracks such fatal fires. None on that list were in Florida. Steube admitted that he misspoke -- he meant to say no children died in school fires in Florida.

128,pomt-04712,"Says Gov. Chris Christie has embarked on a tour to ""demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest.""",false,/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/02/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-says-chris-christie-embarked-tour-de/,"Even before Gov. Chris Christie stepped on stage Tuesday night to deliver his keynote address at the Republican National Convention, New Jersey Democrats were criticizing the governor for exaggerating his success as the state’s chief executive. Barbara Buono, a Senate Democrat from Middlesex County who has said she is ""seriously considering"" a 2013 bid for governor, took aim at Christie in an opinion column published in Politico late Monday night for making ""wildly optimistic"" revenue projections to prove New Jersey can afford a tax cut. ""Being honest about the numbers would undermine the ‘Endless Summer’ tour that Christie has embarked on to demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest – regardless of whether the state can afford it,"" Buono wrote. Here, however, it’s Buono that’s not being forthright. Although Christie initially proposed in January to cut income taxes 10 percent across-the-board over three years, he backed off that proposal before the start of his ""Endless Summer"" tour. Christie now supports a plan based on a proposal from the Senate Democrats that would provide homeowners with an income tax credit based on their property tax bills. Under the governor’s original plan higher income filers, who pay more in income taxes, would have benefited more than lower income filers. But under the plan Christie now supports -- the plan he signed onto before kicking off his tour of New Jersey to blast Democrats for not approving a tax cut -- that’s not the case since some wealthy individuals would not even qualify for a tax cut. On July 2, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill increasing the state’s top income tax rate on millionaires to enhance property tax relief payments for certain residents. Christie suggested turning that legislation into a tax cut plan based on a proposal the Senate Democrats released earlier in the year. Under Christie's new proposal, homeowners who earn $400,000 or less in taxable income would receive an income tax credit based on their property tax bill. The credit would be phased in over four years, reaching 10 percent of the first $10,000 homeowners pay in property taxes. The maximum credit under the plan would be $1,000. To support the state senator’s claim, Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, pointed to a July 26 news article that quotes Christie saying: ""I'm fighting for the tax cut now because you know, businesspeople are making decisions now about whether they're going to expand next year. The Democrats say we'll get to it. We'll get to the tax cut in December or January. Well that's going to be too late for 2013. Those businesspeople are already going to be deciding where they're going to invest their money, where they're going to spend."" But Christie just says tax cut, not income tax cut. And still, he has publicly backed off his original proposal and put forth a plan based on a homeowner’s property tax burden. It’s also worth noting that Christie’s conditional veto also recommended restoring a cut he made during his first year in office to the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program which benefits lower income individuals. The conditional veto increased the state credit to 25 percent of the federal credit amount, up from 20 percent. Our ruling Buono said that Christie embarked on an ""Endless Summer"" tour to ""demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest."" Christie first proposed an across-the-board income tax cut that would have benefited higher income filers more than lower income filers. But Christie has since backed off that plan. Before the governor kicked off his ""Endless Summer"" tour, he signed on to a version of the Senate Democrats’ plan to give an income tax credit based on individuals’ property tax bills.

129,pomt-08648,"Allen West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and said ""this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it.""",false,/florida/statements/2010/sep/15/ron-klein/klein-says-west-called-social-security-ponzi-schem/,"What do you get when you mix a Democratic congressman facing a tough re-election battle, an outspoken Republican challenger famous for his rhetoric, and an NPR transcript of an interview with a journalist who recently found himself facing some heat for e-mail comments about conservatives? Those are the ingredients for a disputed TV ad. Here are the details: Allen West, the Republican challenging Democratic Rep. Ron Klein in District 22, is known for his unique and often controversial soundbites. As Klein faces West for the second time in two years in the closely Democratic-Republican split South Florida district, he is trying to use West's words against him by portraying him as extreme. In a Sept. 13, 2010, Klein TV ad, the announcer says: ""Allen West has extreme politcal views,'' and then quotes West speaking to a crowd saying: ""I'm just honored to be here today with all of my fellow right wing extremists."" (The ad doesn't state the location of that speech but the Klein campaign said it was from this July 2009 Broward County tea party event seen on YouTube.) The announcer then continues: ""Allen West called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He said this country has got to get on sound footing by destroying it. And West said that Medicare can be cut. Those aren't our values. Allen West. Too extreme for South Florida."" The text on the TV screen reads slightly differently in part from the voiceover: ""Allen West called Social Security a 'Ponzi scheme.' Allen West: said Social Security should be destroyed."" The text on the screen states that the source of those statements is NPR on Feb. 23, 2010. In this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore: Did West call Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and say ""this country has got to get on sound footing by destroying it?"" The district, which spans Broward and Palm Beach counties, has a heavy concentration of retirees so Social Security is a hot-button issue. First we turned to the Klein campaign to ask for their documentation for the ad. Spokesperson Melissa Silverman e-mailed us a transcript of a Feb. 23 NPR interview between NPR Fresh Air host Terry Gross and David Weigel, then a reporter for the Washington Independent, an online news publication. The name of the Fresh Air episode was ""CPAC, the Tea Party and the Remaking of the Right."" Weigel had attended both the Conservative Political Action Conference that had been held about a week before in Washington, D.C., and the National Tea Party Convention, which was held about one month prior to his NPR interview. Around minute 23 of the program, Gross asked: ""So is this a fair statement to make, that a lot of the Tea Partiers not only believe that taxes should be cut but that a lot of the programs that taxes pay for should be extremely cut or maybe even abolished, including Social Security and Medicaid, Medicare? "" Here was Weigel's response: ""That's absolutely true. And they'll put in some caveats about programs that people have paid into for a long time. But, you know, I talked to Allen West, who's kind of the perfect Tea Party candidate. He's a lieutenant - sorry - retired lieutenant colonel. He left the armed services after firing a weapon close to the head of an Iraqi prisoner and getting disciplined for it. ""He ran for Congress in 2008. He talked like this and he lost. But he's running again, and he's raised more money than his opponent -- Congressman Ron Klein. And I talked to him at CPAC. He got on the CPAC bill and he said, yes, Social Security's a Ponzi scheme, it's the biggest Ponzi scheme, but I'm not going to get rid of it right away but I, you know, hint-hint, eventually this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it."" We tracked down Weigel and asked him about his comments about West on NPR. Weigel quit his job blogging for the Washington Post this summer after e-mails he wrote critical of conservatives surfaced. He now works for Slate, an online magazine owned by The Washington Post Company. Weigel said he had spoken to West on various occasions in the past -- including at CPAC but also over the telephone. Weigel said he wasn't positive when and where he interviewed West about Social Security and said he doesn't believe he ever wrote an article or blog about West's comments on Social Security. When Weigel spotted the ad, he said he called the Klein campaign to ask for their source of evidence. The answer: the transcript of his interview on NPR. ""I'm really confused as to why the campaign would do this,"" Weigel said. ""I think it's an interesting thing to pull to start looking for something. It's weird to quote a reporter's take on a conversation he had and portray it as a quote from the candidate."" Weigel said his full statement about West wasn't a direct quote. ""I remember 'Ponzi scheme' because that is not a word everyone uses,'' he said. ""It's a word a lot of Republicans use. I was explaining what the conversation (with West) was about. I wasn't saying 'here was a direct quote about that guy.' To grab those two things and say those are quotes from him is kind of odd."" Weigel said when he spoke to Silverman at Klein's campaign, she asked him if he stood by his reporting. He says he does. ""The only thing I can say is I phrased it that way and everyone was fine with it in February 2010. It definitely is what Allen was thinking,'' Weigel said. However, ""that's a weird thing for a campaign to do -- use a reporter paraphrasing something."" Weigel said since the ad surfaced he looked through some old notes but couldn't find the Social Security conversation with West. We found at least a few articles or blogs Weigel wrote that focused on or mentioned West. Weigel wrote an Aug. 24 profile of the West-Klein race for Slate that didn't mention Social Security with the subheadline: ""Florida's Allen West may be crazy, but so far this year, that hasn't hurt Republicans."" On his campaign blog, West criticized Weigel who ""had the delusional gall to declare me, well, crazy."" Weigel also wrote a short piece Feb. 19 on terrorism issues discussed at CPAC for the Washington Independent that mentioned West and a June 23 Right Now Washington Post blog on black Republicans. Neither mentioned West's views on Social Security. We also did a Nexis search for West and Social Security during the past five years and found no articles -- other than a discussion about Klein's ad -- in which West was quoted or paraphrased as stating Social Security is a Ponzi scheme or should be destroyed. We told Silverman that Weigel said his comments during the NPR interview were not direct quotes but rather him recounting what West said. We asked if that was the campaign's only source of evidence and if they still stood by their ad and why. She wrote: ""The campaign stands behind this ad. It is an accurate reflection of Allen West's dangerous and extreme views on Social Security and Medicare."" We asked West's campaign manager Josh Grodin whether West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and made the comments about destroying it. ""I don't have time to go through every video,"" Grodin said in an interview Sept. 14. ""I think the onus is on the Klein campaign. .... I would have to go through dozens and dozens of videos."" At PolitFact Florida, we agree that the onus to prove a claim is on the campaign or person making it, but we also do additional research. Grodin asked us to send him Klein's documentation, so we sent him the NPR transcript. ""The Klein campaign is citing a claim by David Weigel. A guy who has lost all credibility and has no journalistic integrity whatsoever is making a claim? That's pathetic. There is nothing else to say about that."" Again we asked Grodin, did West make the statements? ""Has Allen ever called Social Security a Ponzi scheme? I don't know,"" Grodin said. ""Has he ever said we need to get on the right footing by destroying it? No. That's ridiculous."" So Grodin denies the remark about destroying Social Security, but the campaign isn't confirming or denying the Ponzi scheme comment On the issues section of West's website, he has a brief description about Social Security: ""The critical aspect of Social Security is that we must restore it to the independent trust fund account. Once the politicians moved it to the general operating account, they used it for their pork barrel spending spree. The fact that we are creating a jobless morass in America means there are less workers paying into the system. This is another reason why we need private sector growth, which in turn creates jobs, which will replenish the Social Security fund."" So how does Klein's claim stack up? The TV ad said West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and said ""this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it."" The Klein campaign relied on one source of evidence: an NPR transcript of an interview with a reporter who now says that his description of West was a paraphrase, not a quote -- though he does remember West using the phrase ""Ponzi scheme."" We don't think a reporter's description of what a candidate says can stand as the sole source for an attack ad, particularly when neither the reporter nor the Klein campaign can find anything he wrote about West's comments on Social Security. We couldn't find any proof that West said it, and we find Klein's proof insufficient. We rate this claim False.",None,Ron Klein,None,None,None,2010-09-15T18:12:04,2010-09-13,['None']
130,pomt-02398,"Says President Barack Obama ""is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-barack-obama-first-president-who-thi/,"Critics of President Barack Obama have charged that he has regularly exceeded the powers of his office in selectively enforcing the law. Their examples include making recess appointments, issuing executive orders, delaying provisions of his health care law, refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court and declining to deport certain categories of young illegal immigrants. At the 2014 CPAC conference, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reiterated this point to the audience of conservative activists. Referring to Obama, Cruz said, ""This president of the United States is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore."" We were suspicious of this claim, because we recalled several instances in recent years of other presidents being accused of exceeding their executive authority. We checked with eight historians and legal scholars across the ideological spectrum to see whether they could point to prior examples of presidents choosing to ignore laws. They came up with a number of examples. (Cruz’s office did not return an inquiry for this story.) While Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he believes Obama is ""setting records for the number, scope, and creativity of unconstitutional and illegal behavior,"" he acknowledged that ""Obama wasn't the first president to violate the law and won't be the last."" Here’s a trip down memory lane to review just some of the instances in which presidents are believed to have acted in ways that ignored existing legal or constitutional limits: • Abraham Lincoln. During the Civil War era, Lincoln ""broke an assortment of laws and ignored one constitutional provision after another,"" according to an analysis by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. Lincoln waged war without a congressional declaration of war (or even a Congress in session to declare one), spent $2 million to raise an army without congressional appropriation, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, among other actions. ""Following a strategy of ‘unilateral action,’ Lincoln justified his powers as an emergency authority granted to him by the people,"" the Miller Center analysis concludes. ""He had been elected, he told his critics, to decide when an emergency existed and to take all measures required to deal with it. In doing so, Lincoln maintained that the President was one of three ‘coordinate’ departments of government, not in any way subordinate to Congress or the courts."" • Andrew Johnson. After the Civil War ended and Lincoln was assassinated, Andrew Johnson became president and almost immediately clashed with Congress over how to treat the former Confederacy. Edwin M. Stanton, who had been Secretary of War under Lincoln, retained his position under Johnson and became one of the new president’s biggest critics, asserting that the federal government should intervene more forcefully to protect freed slaves’ rights in the South. In 1867, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval before a president fired federal officials who had originally been confirmed by the Senate. When Johnson tried to oust Stanton, the Senate blocked him; when Johnson made a second ouster attempt, the House impeached him. (Johnson ultimately survived impeachment, Stanton resigned, and the Tenure of Office Act was repealed in 1887.) • Franklin Delano Roosevelt. On March 11, 1941, as World War II was already under way in Europe -- and while the United States was still officially on the sidelines -- Roosevelt signed a landmark law known as the Lend-Lease Act. At the time, Britain was under siege and almost out of money, so the law authorized the president to sell, lease, or lend military hardware to any country he designated as vital to American national security. However, a provision in the law would have allowed Congress to terminate the president’s powers after a certain amount of time through a ""concurrent resolution."" This amounted to a ""legislative veto"" by a simple majority and without the president’s signature. Roosevelt believed this to be unconstitutional, but he signed the bill anyway, secretly writing a memorandum to Attorney General Robert H. Jackson explaining that ""the emergency was so great that I signed the bill in spite of a clearly unconstitutional provision contained in it."" Jackson only made the episode public in 1953. • Harry Truman. In the midst of the Korean War, Truman had to grapple with labor disputes within the steel industry -- a sector he considered vital to the war effort. In a bid to head off a looming work stoppage, Truman in 1952 ordered his Commerce Secretary to seize the steel mills. The industry objected, and Truman’s seizure was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. • Richard Nixon. Citing government spending as a reason for surging inflation, Nixon refused to spend nearly $12 billion of congressionally appropriated funds for 1973 and 1974. He did so under an executive action known as ""impoundment"" -- an action that had been used by many presidents previously, but with questionable constitutionality. Faced with Nixon’s unusually large impoundment -- and with the president bogged down in Watergate -- Congress rebelled, passing legislation to make impoundment illegal. Nixon vetoed the bill, Congress overrode his veto, and Nixon stood his ground. The administration challenged the new law barring impoundment, but a federal court sided with Congress, saying impoundment was unconstitutional. • Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s quest to fight communism suffered a setback in the middle of his first term when the Democratic Congress in 1983 passed the Boland Amendment, which restricted the CIA and the Defense Department from operating in Nicaragua. An even stronger version passed the following year. The Reagan administration diverted some of the proceeds of a secret arms sale to Iran to the anti-communist militia in Nicaragua known as the Contras, an action that directly violated the Boland Amendment. Several top advisers to Reagan were implicated in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair. While the Reagan-appointed Tower Commission said Reagan's disengagement from White House management had made the diversion possible, Reagan himself was never formally linked to the violation of the Boland amendment. • George W. Bush. While president, Bush issued 161 signing statements -- that is, official pronouncements that accompany the signing of a bill into law. In addition to commenting on the law generally, signing statements have been used to document the president’s constitutional objections to provisions contained in the law, and sometimes to announce how (or whether) parts of the law will be enforced. Bush was hardly the first to issue signing statements, but he was the most prolific. According to the Congressional Research Service, Bush issued 161 signing statements, which is a smaller number than each of his three immediate predecessors. But 79 percent of Bush’s statements -- a much higher rate -- noted a challenge or objection to the law being signed, rather than offering relatively innocuous comments. Meanwhile, many statements contained multiple reservations, making the total number more than 1,000. The American Bar Association published a report asserting that Bush’s statements were ""contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers"" when they ""claim the authority or state the intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law ... or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with the clear intent of Congress."" Like Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt before him, Bush ""asserted the power to violate certain laws if necessary to defend the country,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. ""Bush’s signing statements typically said that he would interpret laws restricting executive authority, such as a law forbidding cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees, in a manner consistent with his understanding of his power as commander-in-chief. What that meant, it turned out when the memos were declassified, was that the law did not bind him if he believed certain actions were necessary to national security — the ‘commander-in-chief override.’ "" Our ruling We found that at least seven presidents -- including some of the nation’s most admired occupants of the White House -- acted, at least on occasion, in ways that ignored specific laws or constitutional protections. It is not accurate to say, as Cruz does, that Obama would be ""the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore."" Presidents have done so frequently, and historians expect that they will continue to do so. We rate the claim False. *** EDITOR’S NOTE, March 11, 2014: After we published our story, Cruz’s office provided the following response: ""Since the dawn of the republic, the president and Congress have resisted attempts from each other to encroach upon their constitutional powers. Many presidents have asserted, and have abused, executive authority. No one is arguing that President Obama is the first to make this mistake. As Sen. Cruz has detailed in three reports, a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, no president until President Obama has ever claimed the authority to ignore the explicit text of statutes passed by Congress and unilaterally replace that text with whatever the president wishes. From Obamacare to immigration, to same sex marriage, to marijuana laws, President Obama’s willingness to ignore or alter law is unquestionably outside the scope of executive power. It amounts to legislating, pure and simple."" However, we don’t agree that there’s a significant distinction between ""abus(ing) executive authority"" and a ""willingness to ignore or alter law,"" so we feel comfortable with the historical examples we used to analyze Cruz’s statement.

Scott Walker did an interview on April 25, 2015 with Caffeinated Thoughts, a website that says it looks at ""culture, current events, faith and politics from a Christian and conservative point of view."" When Walker was asked about his position on immigration reform, he began his answer by saying: ""Number of things. Border security for sure. Unlike this president, I’ve actually gone to the border and been there with the governor of Texas,"" Walker said, referring to a trip he made a month earlier. Wait, what? Immigration has long been a huge national issue. Barack Obama has been president for more than six years. Is Walker right that Obama has never been to the Texas-Mexico border? Walker’s evidence AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Our American Revival, the group Walker created in anticipation of a campaign for president, responded to our request for information to back Walker’s statement. She essentially tried to modify the governor’s claim by narrowing the time frame, saying Obama ""chose not to go to the border while he was in Texas in 2014 during a humanitarian crisis"" at the border. Walker, of course, made a much broader claim. But let’s start with his evidence: a July 9, 2014 CBS News report. On the day the report was posted online, Obama arrived in Texas for a previously planned two-day trip that was to involve talking to Texans about the economy and attending Democratic fundraisers. At the time, there had been a surge in the number children and teens from Central America crossing the Mexico-U.S. border unaccompanied by a parent. Many of the youths fled drug violence at home, but faced new challenges in the United States because the border patrol system wasn’t equipped to handle them, according to news reports. Changes in policy to expand legal residence opportunities in the United States for undocumented youth may have led some families to send younger family members on the journey north. Because of the crisis at the border, Obama altered his plans to include a meeting, in Dallas, with then-Gov. Rick Perry and local officials to discuss the situation at the border. But Obama -- resisting calls from lawmakers in both parties -- did not visit the border, although several senior members of his administration had done so. More to the point of Walker’s claim, however, the news report he cited also said Obama had visited the border in May 2011. We found that Obama visited El Paso on May 10, 2011. (Our colleagues rated as True his statement during his speech there that the Border Patrol had doubled the number of its agents since 2004.) A Washington Post report on the speech said Obama was ""standing within sight of Mexico"" and that it was his his first trip to the U.S.-Mexico border as president. That was his only visit to the border as president. Our rating Walker said that ""unlike this president, I've actually gone to the (Texas) border."" Obama certainly hasn’t been a frequent visitor, but as president he did go to the border once, in May 2011 to give a speech on immigration reform. We rate Walker’s statement False.

132,pomt-13176,"Says Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold ""voted over 250 times to raise taxes.""",false,/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/27/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-falsely-claims-250-tax-increa/,"Democrat Russ Feingold spent nearly two decades in the U.S. Senate, and is now trying to win back his old seat from Republican Ron Johnson, who ousted Feingold in 2010. A recent campaign ad from Americans for Prosperity claims one theme permeated Feingold’s tenure in Washington — a push for higher taxes. The conservative political advocacy group even puts a precise number on that claim: ""He voted time and again to make life more expensive for families in Wisconsin,"" the narrator says in the ad, released in August. ""Russ voted over 250 times to raise taxes — 250."" The Club for Growth, another conservative group, used the same figure in an ad released Oct. 12, 2016, wording it as ""250 votes for higher taxes."" Did Feingold really cast that many votes to raise taxes? The matter isn’t as straightforward as the nice round number leads viewers to believe. Disagreement over budget votes When asked for backup, Americans for Prosperity, founded by billionaire businessman and activist David Koch, provided a list of 264 votes dating back to Feingold’s 1993 debut in the U.S. Senate. We did our own research and also sent the list to Feingold’s campaign for feedback. The foundational question is what constitutes a vote to ""raise taxes""? More than half the votes cited in the ad — 150 — came on budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. They are used as blueprints for the budget or in some cases to make a political statement. But PolitiFact has noted repeatedly that it is inaccurate to suggest votes on non-binding budget resolutions are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The resolutions often don’t include precise details and don’t on their own raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. ""You’re voting for kind of an overall map and taking multiple votes on that same map, and not directly raising or lowering taxes in a piece of legislation,"" said Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. Americans for Prosperity contends the votes are a fair addition to the tally. ""Although many of the spending and revenue levels set in budget resolutions require additional legislative action to implement, there are a number of spending and tax policies set by budget resolutions,"" said James Fellinger, a spokesman for the group. ""Budget resolutions enact procedural changes in order to ease the passage of those policies — voting for a budget resolution is plainly supporting the policies it outlines."" The ad’s tally also includes many votes that were actually against tax cuts — not in favor of tax increases. Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said Feingold campaign counted more than 150 such examples among the votes cited by Americans for Prosperity. It’s not merely a semantic distinction. When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a nearly identical claim about votes to raise taxes, three federal budget experts generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut isn’t the same as a vote for a tax increase. Gordon said that element of the ad’s claim ""is probably the worst argument of all of them"" from a fiscal policy perspective. ""The voter reading that is going to believe (Feingold) voted in 250 separate times to raise an individual’s own income tax,"" Gordon said. ""By any standard that sort of accounting is false in terms of what we expect the average voter to take away from the (claim)."" A counting question Meanwhile, there is another problem: Though Americans for Prosperity cited 264 separate votes from Feingold, they came on only 65 pieces of legislation. The votes came on amendments that varied widely in content and scope, so each represented a different position. Nevertheless, that counting approach inflates the total. For example, Feingold cast 34 votes on Senate Concurrent Resolution 23 in 2003, which established Congress’ version of the budget for the following year. Each vote took a position on a proposed change of some kind, but should that count as 34 votes or one? ""Counting multiple votes on the same legislation and all of its permutations just serves to pad the number, but in some cases isn’t completely inaccurate, just not telling the full tale,"" Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact Florida in 2012 when it tackled and rated a similar item. Another problem with the 250 tally: some of the votes come on nuanced, multi-part amendments that are not easily categorized. One example is the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, companion legislation to the Affordable Care Act that helped established Obamacare. Feingold cast three votes on March 24, 2010, against amendments that would exempt certain devices from a 2.3 percent tax (in effect, voting to raise a tax). But the amendment would have offset that by lowering the law’s affordability tax exemption for individuals (voting to lower a tax). Despite the offsetting effect, Americans for Prosperity lists it as a tax increase. Our rating Americans for Prosperity says Feingold voted more than 250 times to raise taxes as a U.S. senator, contending any vote in support of a higher tax should be part of that tally. But that number is built on assumptions and simplifications. Though Feingold cast tax-related votes that many times, more than half of those came on non-binding resolutions that took a position in favor of raising taxes but did not raise taxes by themselves. The claim also does not account for the large number of votes that were actually against a tax cut, not in favor of a tax increase. Experts say that’s a big difference. And it doesn’t acknowledge the nuanced nature of the votes themselves or that many votes came on elements of the same legislation.

133,pomt-13898,"Says Hillary Clinton ""filibustered legislation to reform"" Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/28/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-says-clinton-filibustered-fannie-mae/,"Responsibility for the 2008 housing crisis is at stake in a new attack launched by Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton. ""Hillary Clinton filibustered legislation to reform Fannie and Freddie Mae – institutions at the center of the Great Recession – which have been funneling hundreds of thousands to Hillary Clinton's campaign and Foundation,"" a statement from the Trump campaign said on June 21. Republican changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulation never faced a cloture vote, the most clear-cut procedural sign that a filibuster has occurred. (The statement calls mistakenly calls them Fannie and Freddie Mae). Without a cloture vote, the question of whether the bill was filibustered becomes ""a gray area,"" according to one expert in congressional use of the filibuster. If a filibuster did occur, it's even harder to say that Clinton was responsible. Trump’s statement presumably refers to a Republican-backed attempt in 2005 to bolster regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two huge government-backed mortgage finance companies. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the statement itself cited a CNBC opinion piece. The Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 passed out of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on a party line vote. It was never brought before the full Senate. After the mortgage collapse revealed the vulnerability of America’s housing market, some pointed to the bill as evidence of Republican foresight and Democratic obstruction. Experts disagree on the role Fannie and Freddie played in causing the financial crisis, but they certainly experienced its results: billions were spent bailing out the companies. Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska introduced the bill, and every committee Republican voted to move it out of committee. The question, then, is why Republican leadership did not introduce it on the floor of the full Senate, where they also had a majority. One possibility is that they suspected that Senate Democrats, including Clinton, would oppose the bill as a bloc, as the Democrats on the committee had done. Democrats had enough votes to sustain a successful filibuster if they had wanted to, and the then-Senate minority leader Harry Reid expressed his opposition when the bill passed out of committee. Experts are divided on whether even an explicit threat of a filibuster by the majority should be counted as a use of the filibuster power. The only mention of a filibuster in contemporary coverage of the bill’s progress is a quote from Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut. ""The word ‘filibuster’ is nowhere near the horizon,"" Dodd, a leading opponent of the bill, told reporters after the bill passed out of committee. Democratic and Republican senators both expressed optimism that a compromise version of the bill would go forward. Some accounts of the bill’s progress suggest that Dodd later blocked the bill by telling Sen. Richard Shelby, the head of the committee that passed the bill, that he planned to filibuster it. Democratic opposition was more widely expressed, but some Republican senators may have been reluctant as well. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lobbied some Republican senators to oppose the bill, the Associated Press reported. Without a vote or a public statement, it is impossible to see where individual senators who did not vote on the bill in committee, like Clinton, stood on the issue. Clinton never voted or publicly took a position on the bill. In contemporary reporting about the bill’s progress, her name is not mentioned. Three political scientists we spoke to had different standards for determining when a filibuster occurred, but all agreed that without specific evidence that she took some action to block it, it did not make sense to say Clinton filibustered the bill. ""In the absence of clear evidence, I’m not sure how you ascribe it to Hillary Clinton or any other Democrat,"" Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said. Clinton’s campaigns and the Clinton Foundation have both taken large donations from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s employees and an associated Political Action Committee. In 2008, Clinton was the fourth highest recipient of donations from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s employees and PACs. Our ruling In an attempt to assign responsibility for the financial crisis to Clinton, Trump’s campaign accused her of filibustering legislation that would have changed how two government-backed mortgage giants were regulated. Republican leadership chose not to bring the bill before the whole Senate after it passed out of committee. It is possible that they thought Democratic senators would filibuster, but based on the evidence available, we found no evidence that Clinton herself took any action in relation to the bill.

134,pomt-13639,"""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-michigan-job-losses-coal-/,"During an economic address at the Detroit Economic Club, Donald Trump tailored some of his statistics to the local audience. ""As a result of recent Obama EPA actions, coal-fired plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions, making them non-competitive in many cases,"" Trump said. ""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" Trump has often criticized efforts by the Obama administration -- and those who find climate change to be a serious concern -- to wean the United States from fossil fuels by tightening federal environmental regulation of coal-fired power plants. Here, we’ll take a look at the second part of Trump’s statement: ""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" This assertion initially caught our eye because we’d never thought of Michigan as one of the premier coal-producing states. Our suspicion was correct: According to the National Mining Association, Michigan is not on the list of 26 states that currently produce any amount of coal. Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of workers engaged in any type of mining in Michigan over the last decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000, making it essentially impossible to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in that sector. And as the Washington Examiner has noted, Michigan has fewer than 20,000 people working in the electricity generation sector today. So the scale of the job losses Trump cites seem, at least at first blush, to be unlikely. So what was Trump trying to say? The prepared version of his speech includes a footnote that points to a news release from the National Mining Association published almost five years ago, on Sept. 7, 2011. Here are some excerpts from that news release, which criticized ""Beyond Coal,"" a campaign against coal-fired power plants coordinated by the environmental group the Sierra Club and cited a study the group released: ""The destructive impact of the ‘Beyond Coal’ campaign is most clearly evident in the following 10 states where power plants blocked by the club represent the highest number of potential jobs (construction and permanent) foregone: Illinois (126,612), Texas (122,065), Montana (114,102), Nevada (75,194), Florida (75,055), Ohio (70,371), Colorado (55,620), Michigan (53,587), Oklahoma (42,581) and Kentucky (38,824)."" In response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, Andrew Wheeler, an energy adviser to the Trump campaign, also pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis that found that 10 delayed or canceled projects in Michigan -- most of them coal-fired plants -- would have created 56,000 jobs up front had they been built. Between the 53,000 jobs cited by the National Mining Association and the 56,000 jobs cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Wheeler said, ""it is obvious that the ‘over 50,000 jobs’ cited by Mr. Trump is accurate."" But just because a campaign is able to footnote a specific number doesn’t mean that the number is meaningful, or as fully contextualized as it ought to be. Here are a few important things to know about this number. • The number refers to ""potential"" jobs lost, not actual jobs lost. This is an important point that would not be obvious from the way Trump phrased his statement. By leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost, Trump’s statistic invites a degree of outrage that isn’t warranted. And there are good reasons to be cautious about future job projections, especially when they have been framed so broadly as to include vendors to the industry, rail transport, ports and machinery manufacturers. Any job projections of this sort are subject to rosy estimates -- especially if a group has a vested interest in the issue. In making an argument to the public, all groups will put forward their most favorable case. Trey Pollard, the national press secretary for the Sierra Club -- which has its own dog in the fight -- said the number of plants being counted by the mining association are essentially ""the coal industry’s wildest dreams"" -- a reflection of circumstances in which they can build coal plants ""in any community they want to."" • The number doesn’t reflect that coal is increasingly being replaced by natural gas. Trump’s decision to use this number tells only part of the story of how the electricity sector has been developing. In recent years, according to federal statistics, coal has been losing ground to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy when it comes to electricity generation. A July 2016 analysis by Sam Evans of the School of Business and Economics at King University in Bristol, Tenn., found that environmental regulation has been a factor in this switch, but a ""secondary"" one. ""The recent decline in the generation share of coal, and the concurrent rise in the share of natural gas, was mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices that have made natural gas generation more economically attractive,"" Evans wrote. • This isn’t just about Obama or Clinton. Trump ignores that much of the impetus in Michigan for switching away from coal has come from the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, and from utilities themselves. Snyder has generally continued his support for steps to shift away from coal that began under his Democratic predecessor as governor, Jennifer Granholm. In 2015, Snyder said at an energy conference that ""now is the time to look at a long-term transition away from coal,"" adding that because of the state’s natural gas infrastructure, ""we're well positioned to actually have a fair amount of that coal demand go to natural gas."" And Gerry Anderson, the chairman and CEO of DTE Energy, an electric utility that serves more than 2 million customers in the state, has written that ""we plan to retire older, less efficient coal plants and build new, cleaner natural gas power plants over the next decade."" Our ruling Trump said that ""the Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" However, this claim is problematic on several levels. While the number matches one projection of how many potential jobs could be lost from the blockage of coal-fired plants, there’s a difference between actual jobs lost and potential future jobs lost. And the number cited -- an impossible-to-confirm projection based on broadly construed calculations released by a pro-coal group -- should be taken with a big grain of salt. Trump also ignores that market forces, not just environmental regulations, have driven many of the job losses in the coal sector, and he also ignores that Michigan Republican officials and utilities themselves -- not just the Obama administration -- have pushed the switch away from coal.

135,pomt-10525,"""We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/05/barack-obama/straight-talk-twisted/,"The Democratic candidates and groups that oppose John McCain have been quoting the Arizona senator as saying the United States could be in Iraq for 1,000 years. ""John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq,"" Rose Forrest, an Iraq war veteran, says in an ad for VoteVets.org that aired in Washington, D.C., in late February and is still available on the Web. ""That's some commitment to the Iraqi people, Sen. McCain."" A YouTube video known as ""John He Is"" uses humor to make the same point. It spoofs a pro-Obama music video called Yes We Can . The parody has grainy footage of McCain saying, ""I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years or a thousand years or 10,000 years"" and ends with these words on the screen: ""IRAQ WITHDRAWAL DATE: 12,008 . . . . GOOD LUCK WITH THAT IN NOVEMBER."" (We're not putting the parody to the Truth-O-Meter, but it's worth checking out to see a funny perspective on McCain's comments.) Sen. Barack Obama made a similar charge (but without the catchy music) during the Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Feb. 26, 2008, when he said, ""We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years."" The videos and Obama's statement made us wonder about the full context of McCain's remarks and whether the comments were portrayed accurately. We've previously addressed Sen. Hillary Clinton's claim about the 100-year remark with this item, but McCain has elaborated since then. So in this article, we will examine the new claims. It's well known that McCain has been a strong supporter of the Iraq war, even when his position harmed his presidential campaign. At a town hall in Derry, N.H., on Jan. 3, 2008, McCain was glib about the need for a long-term U.S. commitment: QUESTION: ""President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years — "" McCAIN: ""Make it a hundred."" Q: ""Is that — "" McCAIN: ""We've been in South Korea . . . we've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea 50 years or so. That would be fine with me. As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, that's fine with me. I hope that would be fine with you, if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al-Qaida is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day."" Three days later, he was asked about the remark on CBS's Face the Nation. He likened the future U.S. role in Iraq to other nations where the United States has a military presence: ""My point was and continues to be, how long do we have to stay in Bosnia? How long do we have to stay in South Korea? How long are we going to stay in Japan? How long are we going to stay in Germany? All of those, 50-, 60-year period. No one complains. In fact, they contribute enormously, their presence, to stability in the world,"" McCain said. ""The point is, it's American casualties. We've got to get Americans off the front line, have the Iraqis as part of the strategy, take over more and more of the responsibilities. And then I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for 100 years or 1,000 years or 10,000 years. What they care about is a sacrifice of our most precious treasure, and that's American blood. So what I'm saying is look, if Americans are there in a support role, but they're not taking casualties, that's fine."" When McCain was asked about the remark Jan. 9 on ABC's Good Morning America, he said the U.S. presence could last 1-million years: ""Could be 1,000 years or a million years,"" he said. ""We have bases in Kuwait right now. We have bases in South Korea and Japan, Germany. I mean (the allegation by critics is) a straw man. It's a fallacious argument by people who don't understand that it's not American presence, it's American casualties. If we can get American casualties down and eliminate them, Americans are not concerned — in fact, they may be glad we have a secure base in that part of the world as we do in Kuwait."" The interviews show McCain is not advocating that the war in Iraq continue for a thousand years (or a million). But once combat ends and U.S. casualities dwindle, he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Germany. That presence could continue for many years. Clinton correctly described the first remark by saying ""Sen. McCain said the other day that we might have troops (in Iraq) for 100 years.""

136,pomt-01785,"""The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200.""",false,/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/27/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-cranston-mayor-allan-fung-increased/,"Cranston’s new automated trash collection system, approved in February, is just getting under way, but it has already raised a stink. Ken Block, a Republican candidate for governor, argues that the new program comes at an additional cost. He claims that Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, his gubernatorial primary opponent, has raised ""the garbage tax"" by ""as much as $200 for some residents."" Block raised the issue during a debate with Fung on Rhode Island Public Radio on July 15, 2014. When it was Block’s turn to ask Fung a question, he said, ""You know, I’ve heard from a number of Cranston residents, including a few CPAs, that the increase in the garbage tax that you’ve imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200 dollars. And for a number of people in Cranston, that’s equivalent to what is in effect a five-percent increase in their property tax … ""So my question to you is: When you talk about not increasing taxes but you’re charging some people the equivalent of 5 percent increase in property taxes, with $200 to collect garbage where they paid much less than the year before, how do you explain that, and do you think that’s acceptable? I hear from a ton of people we talked to in Cranston; they’re very unhappy with this."" In response, Fung said he’d heard from many residents that they’re happy with the new system. ""I’m not sure where you’re talking about a garbage tax,"" he said. ""We haven’t raised taxes."" Garbage tax? $200 increase? Equivalent to 5-percent tax increase? Is this just a lot of trash talk? Here are the facts, according to the city’s website and the mayor’s office: Cranston’s new automated trash pickup system,which started in June, is intended to boost the city’s recycling rate from 23 percent to the state’s goal of 35 percent and potentially earn rebates; keep the city cleaner by using closed containers; and reduce the rodent population by using the largely chew-proof barrels. All in all, it should make for a cleaner, sweeter-smelling Cranston with an eased ""critter"" problem. As part of the program, Cranston residents have received two new, free 65-gallon rolling barrels, one for trash, the other for recyclables. Residents can opt for smaller, 35-gallon bins if the larger ones are too unwieldy. Residents who want a third barrel must pay $150 per year. There’s another change: the city no longer removes bulky items and appliances for free. Residents must pay $18 per bulky item, and $25 per mattress or box spring. The bottom line: There is no new ""garbage tax,"" but there new fees for services that were free before. Now let’s examine Block’s claim. When we asked the Block campaign what he was talking about, they emailed us a five-page response, contending that he was referring to the charge for the optional extra barrels, and the new removal fees for bulky items. We should note that, in his back-and-forth with Fung, Block at one point said: ""You don’t want to call it a tax - let’s call it a fee. They’re now paying a fee …"" But he also used the words ""tax"" or ""taxes"" six times in roughly 30 seconds. In his email, Block explained his math. ""The fact of the matter is that the citizens of Cranston are paying much more for trash removal than they were in the prior year when it was already done as a service paid for by their tax dollars,"" Block wrote. ""Collectively every household that has an extra bin ($150), plus any household that has a large curbside item ($18 per item) adds up to a sum of money that Cranston taxpayers are collectively paying for out of pocket that they didn’t pay for the year before -- call it a fee, call it a tax, call it whatever, but many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago."" As for the five percent: ""If a homeowner has an annual property tax bill of $4,000 and he/she needs to purchase an extra bin, and also pay for three curbside items, ""then he /she is paying approximately $300 in new fees, which is a 5% increase over their $4,000 tax bill."" OK, but just a second. How many is ""many"" when we’re talking about people paying for additional bins? Block cites 2008 Environmental Protection Agency estimates that each person in the U.S. ""creates a daily average of 4.5 pounds of solid waste."" From that, Block extrapolates that ""each person creates approximately 30 pounds of solid waste per week"" in concluding that ""larger families will need an extra bin or bins."" Block also noted that the 65-gallon barrels provided in Cranston are smaller than the 90-gallon barrels provided in nearby Warwick. And he noted that residents who previously could discard bulky items such as sofas, carpets and mattresses will now have to pay extra fees. It’s a little early to predict how many people in Cranston will be paying extra for bulky waste or renting extra bins. But to date, out of 28,600 residential units that have received barrels, only 80 have requested an additional trash bin - or 0.3 percent, the mayor says. Fung also called Block’s statement ""false in a number of respects"" and noted that there hasn’t been an increase in property taxes for three years. ""So even if a portion of the regular property tax were to be segregated or designated as paying for refuse removal services, the statement that there has been an ‘increase’ is false, because the overall tax rate has stayed constant for three consecutive years,"" he said. Our ruling During a radio debate, Ken Block said, ""The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200."" He then mentioned the word ""tax or taxes"" five more times. But there is no garbage tax. And only those who request an extra barrel or are discarding bulky items and mattresses will pay any extra fees. In fairness, Block later used the word ""fee,"" and ""additional fee."" But we believe the average listener would conclude that Block was talking about a hike in -- or extra fee beyond -- an existing ""garbage tax."" In addition, Block’s claim that ""many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago,"" is sweeping generalization. Only 80 residents have so far requested an extra barrel. We won’t say that Block’s claim is a whole lot of garbage. But it certainly misleads and exaggerates. We rule his statement False.

137,pomt-09741,"Forty-five percent of doctors ""say they'll quit"" if health care reform passes.",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/15/glenn-beck/beck-says-45-percent-physicians-would-quit-if-heal/,"Physicians are important players in the health care debate. They've been courted by both supporters and opponents of the Democratic reform plan. President Barack Obama held a Rose Garden ceremony with some of them recently. And now opponents of the Democratic health care plan are citing poll results that supposedly show that lots of doctors would be so unhappy with the reforms that they'd quit their jobs. Fox News Channel political commentator Glenn Beck mentioned this on his Oct. 12, 2009, show during a wide-ranging critique of the Democratic plan. He said that the plan could harm doctors financially and make medical students have doubts about pursuing the profession. ""Do you really think that you're going to see an increase in medical students? I don't think so,"" Beck said. ""Especially consider that the percentage of doctors who say they'll quit if this is passed is only 45 percent. No worries. Ha! You'll be able to find a good doctor. Really, you will."" If true, the sudden departure of 45 percent of the nation's doctors would indeed constitute a stinging rejection of the Democratic effort by an influential health care constituency. But that number sounded high to us, so we decided to look into the statistic's origins. It came from a survey of ""practicing physicians"" published in mid September. The survey was sponsored by the newspaper Investor's Business Daily and was done by the firm TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics, or TIPP. The survey was conducted between Aug. 28, 2009, and Sept. 15, 2009. It was mailed to 25,600 physicians nationwide at addresses purchased from a list broker. We found several problems with the poll and the way Beck described its results: • Beck misstated what the poll asked . Beck said that 45 percent of doctors will quit. But in fact, the poll found that 45 percent of doctors said they will consider quitting. Considering quitting isn't the same thing as quitting, which makes Beck's statement a significant exaggeration. In addition, the specific question asked of respondents was, ""If Congress passes their health care plan, will you ... continue your practice, [or] consider leaving your practice or taking an early retirement?"" This wording leaves open the possibility that respondents are saying they might simply leave their current practice to join another practice, rather than quit. • The poll had a low response rate . According to the statistics published in IBD , 1,376 practicing physicians responded to the poll, out of the 25,600 solicited nationally. That's a 5.4 percent response rate. In one of its articles about the poll, IBD bills this as ""a high rate of return, considering how difficult doctors are to get hold of."" But another survey of doctors released around the same time managed to do better — much better. That other survey was conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, who published the results in the New England Journal of Medicine . They mailed 5,157 questionnaires and got a response rate that exceeded 43 percent — nearly eight times the IBD survey's rate. In fact, Keyhani and Federman reached almost 50 percent more doctors despite sending out only one-fifth the number of inquiries. (They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the other poll did.) Does a higher response rate matter? In this case, it's hard to know for sure, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. However, she added, ""higher response rates give me more confidence in results,"" a point echoed by other experts we interviewed. • The sponsor was listed prominently on the survey, possibly influencing who responded . The survey was sent out on Investor’s Business Daily letterhead, and the introduction said in part, ""The results of this survey will be on Investor’s Business Daily’s front page and investors.com. A press release will also be prepared. This will give doctors a voice in this key issue."" This type of framing matters because IBD 's editorial page is known for its conservative stance, including opposition to the Democratic health care effort. While it’s safe to assume that not everyone who received the survey knew about IBD 's political leanings, some respondents presumably did — and among those who did, such knowledge could have made a difference in determining who responded. Liberals might have been less likely to respond, while conservatives in tune with the IBD editorials would have been more enthusiastic about responding. In such a small sample, even a modest bias of that sort could skew the results. • The wording of questions may have influenced who responded . In an interview, Mark Blumenthal, who blogs at pollster.com and has written critically of the IBD poll, said the wording of the questions could have skewed the results. He noted that, unlike telephone polls, mail polls enable the recipient to skim the entire list of questions before deciding to answer any of them. With the IBD poll, respondents might have thought some of the questions had a subtext that was critical of the Democratic proposal. One was, ""Do you believe the government can cover 47 million more people and it will cost less money and the quality of care will be better?"" Another was, ""If Congress passes their plan, do you expect fewer students to apply to med schools in the future [or] more students to apply to med schools in the future?"" A third was, ""Under a government plan, do you think drug companies will have incentives to continue developing as many life saving new drugs?"" (Grammatical errors in original; full survey text available here.) ""Collectively, these questions imply that health care reform will mean very bad things for medicine,"" Blumenthal said. ""I'm guessing that a proreform doctor would be inclined to ignore, and not return, a survey if the questions seem leading or biased."" Could the prominence of the IBD name and the question wording have made a difference? The evidence suggests that may be true. In the IBD poll, 65 percent of the doctors who responded said they opposed ""government's proposed health care plan"" while just 33 percent supported it. By contrast, the Keyhani-Federman poll found that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, as congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama have advocated. Another 10 percent said they favored a single-payer health care system — a solution that is actually to the left of the president. In other words, the results of the two polls are so far apart that they are essentially opposites. The truth may actually lie somewhere in between the two surveys. It's worth noting that the Keyhani-Federman poll received financial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which favors health care reform. Also, National Public Radio has said that ""Keyhani and Federman belong to ... the National Physicians Alliance. It supports a public option, and Keyhani has spoken publicly about her own support for a public option."" A campaign finance database search found that both researchers donated to the Obama campaign in 2008 — $500 from Keyhani and $300 from Federman. In addition, the initial postcard Keyhani and Federman sent to doctors included the subheading, ""Congress wants to hear from doctors on health care reform"" — advocacy-style language similar to what the IBD poll said. This may have produced some ideological bias in the opposite direction from IBD 's poll. (In an interview, Federman said the reason for choosing the words they did stemmed from ""what the literature shows about what works to get docs to respond to surveys."") Finally, Don Dillman, an expert in mail-based polls and a professor at Washington State University, suggests another factor that could make the IBD poll results on doctors quitting vastly overstated: People don't usually make decisions about changing careers lightly. ""If one is trained to be a physician, then are you going to take on another occupation?"" he asks. This concern is especially relevant for younger physicians, who would likely find few new careers that would earn them enough income to pay off their debts from attending medical school. So, back to Beck's statement. First, he misstated the results of the poll. The survey didn't say 45 percent would quit; it said they would consider quitting, which is considerably different. Moreover, polling experts have raised significant questions about the poll's methodology. Of special concern are the combination of the heavy mention of IBD 's name and questions that experts said appeared to be seeking answers critical of health reform. We'd like to see an independent poll assessing doctors' views of health care reform, but neither the findings from the IBD survey nor those from the Keyhani-Federman study are fully persuasive to us.

On Oct. 25, he tweeted, ""Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. Great support from so many sides. Big winners will be the middle class, business & JOBS."" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That same day, he told Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network, ""We’re bringing the corporate rate down to 20 percent from 35 percent. ... This will be the biggest tax cut in history. In the history of our country."" See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com But is it? Tax experts say no. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry.) The current tax proposal is still a work in progress, but the Senate budget resolution allows it to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. An estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests that, when all is said and done, the reduction in tax revenues will increase to $2.2 trillion over 10 years. So based on what we know now, the tax proposal will probably amount to between $150 billion and $220 billion per year. That doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever. The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product — two metrics that experts say give a sense of scale. Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, at least one tax bill on the Treasury list, and possibly others, were larger. Here’s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars: Tax bill Inflation-adjusted dollars American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) $321 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 $210 billion Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 $208 billion Current tax proposal $150 billion - $220 billion Revenue Act of 1964 $64 billion Revenue Act of 1945 $60 billion Revenue Act of 1978 $55 billion Revenue Act of 1948 $38 billion At least the 2013 bill -- and possibly the 2010 and 1981 bills -- exceeded the current bill in inflation-adjusted tax cuts, depending on what figure you project for the current bill. And here are the tax laws ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP: Tax bill Percentage of GDP Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 2.89 percent Revenue Act of 1945 2.67 percent Revenue Act of 1948 1.87 percent American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) 1.78 percent Revenue Act of 1964 1.6 percent Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 1.31 percent Current tax proposal 0.8 percent-1.2 percent Revenue Act of 1978 0.8 percent By this measurement, at least six bills cut taxes by more than the current proposal. A seventh, the Revenue Act of 1978, is essentially tied with the current proposal as a percentage of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut, from 1921, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP. The group added in a blog post that ""if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years."" No formulation of the current proposal is close to that. ""Unless lawmakers scrap their current plans for tax reform and start over from scratch, it’s simply implausible to claim that this legislation will provide the largest tax cut in U.S. history,"" said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at the group Tax Analysts. Our ruling Trump said the GOP tax plan he is supporting is ""the biggest tax cut in U.S. history."" Even the most expansive estimate for the current proposal’s tax cut is exceeded by the 1981 tax cut in inflation-adjusted dollars. And as a percentage of GDP, a half-dozen or more previous tax cuts were larger. We rate the statement False.

139,pomt-13691,"""Only five Texas counties account for almost 90 percent of the (state’s) cattle industry.""",false,/texas/statements/2016/jul/29/jeannette-vaught/researcher-rounds-wrong-figure-texas-cattle/,"From the citrus of the Rio Grande Valley to the peaches of the Texas Hill Country, many crops flourish across the vast expanse of the Lone Star State. Ask just about anybody about Texas agriculture, however, and the first offering that often comes to mind is beef. In a May 4, 2016 op-ed article in the Austin American-Statesman, University of Texas lecturer Jeannette Vaught suggested that’s not coincidental. Her dissertation on the same subject is being published as a book. She argued that the promotion of beef culture, in part by politicians such as the Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, means it’s recognized as the epitome of Texas agriculture. Even though, she writes, it hails predominantly from one part of the state and economically benefits a small region. This obscures the actual diversity of agricultural production in Texas, she said. Vaught wrote that only five counties out of the state’s 254 account for almost 90 percent of the state’s cattle industry. With almost any drive beyond the state’s urban areas incomplete without a few cow sightings, we wondered if the state’s beef cattle are concentrated in just a few counties. Vaught, asked to provide factual backup, said she relied on Texas statistics posted by the National Agricultural Statistics Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ""It's arresting,"" Vaught said by email, ""because cows are visible everywhere! But they are super concentrated in feedlots in the counties surrounding Lubbock."" Feedlots are designated lots of land where cattle are given a specific type of feed before slaughter. We sought to check on the data on the NASS Quick Stats website, learning that the agency annually surveys some 38,000 cattle producers to gauge the state of the country’s cattle industry by mail, phone, online and in face-to-face interviews. For the 2015 survey behind Vaught’s claim, producers were asked to report cattle inventories based on Jan. 1, 2016 counts. To our inquiry, Michael Klamm, a cattle statistician with NASS, walked us through the database to those latest counts. Separately, we reached out to the Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, the largest and oldest livestock association in the state, to see if Vaught’s claim sounded familiar. Laramie Adams, director of public affairs for the group, told us by phone that the NASS data is the complete source for cattle data. We checked back with Klamm at NASS, who wrote back that the inventory category we used included all cattle, both dairy and beef cattle. From our analysis, the five counties with the largest cattle counts (Deaf Smith, Castro, Parmer, Hartley and Hansford), as of January 2016 had a total of 1,980,000 head of cattle out of a total 11,700,000 in the state, or 16.9 percent. While those counties lie in the state’s Panhandle region, at most a three-hour drive from Lubbock, the counties don’t account for anywhere close to the 90 percent Vaught tied to just five counties. By our calculation, the federally collected counts place 90 percent of Texas cattle across 157 counties, spread from regions that include the Panhandle, Blackland Prairies and Cross Timbers region in north and central Texas, to name a few. We circled back to Vaught with our findings. When she checked the NASS state facts, she advised, she misread a map that mapped out cattle counts by county and, Vaught said, ""neglected to break down the math step by step, and made a terribly under-informed estimate that supported my initial assumption that feedlots in North Texas concentrated cattle at rates far higher than the rest of the state."" Still, Vaught said, five counties accounting for 16.9 percent is ""still significant, given that there are 254 counties in Texas, each one reporting cattle inventory."" Our ruling Vaught wrote that only five Texas counties account for 90 percent of the state’s cattle industry. However, after checking with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service and looking at the most recent inventory, we found the percentage to be far lower. We rate this claim False.

Scott Walker had it two ways while defending his state’s economic record during a stop in Minnesota as he moves toward a 2016 presidential bid. Some media outlets interpreted his remarks as pushing back on the idea that Wisconsin’s economic recovery trails that of Minnesota, where Democrat Mark Dayton is governor. But Walker also spoke of Minnesota’s ""advantage"" in terms of economic growth and attributed it to politics. ""For many years, when (Republican Gov. Tim) Pawlenty was in office, the state was doing quite well,"" Walker said. ""You've had the advantage of having, other than a two-year period, Republicans in charge of at least one part of government for at least some time,"" Walker added, then noted. ""Before we came into office, for many years there was a Democratic governor, a Democratic Assembly and a Democratic Senate."" We can’t fact check Walker’s implication that Wisconsin fell behind because Democrats were running the whole show. That’s his opinion. But we can check his facts on who was in charge and when. Walker didn’t say how far back his comparison went, but his mention of Pawlenty suggests at least 2003, when Pawlenty was first elected. Here’s what we found when examining partisan control in both states: Minnesota Pawlenty served two terms, from 2003 through 2010, giving way to Dayton at the same time Walker assumed power in Madison in January 2011. So that means Republicans controlled at least one key lever for those eight years. From 2011 to present it’s been Dayton, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, in the governor’s chair in St. Paul. Republicans held both legislative chambers in 2011-12, and one starting in 2015. But Democrats -- as Walker correctly noted -- ran both chambers from 2013-14 and of course had Dayton for those years as well. Wisconsin Walker confined his argument here to the years before he took office in 2011. But he misfires in saying Democrats had a total lock on power for ""many years."" Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle took office in Wisconsin in 2003 -- at the same time Pawlenty assumed control next door. Doyle also served eight years, then decided not to run for a third term. But Doyle only had a Legislature under total Democratic control for his last two years, 2009 and 2010. In fact, Republicans controlled the Assembly and Senate for Doyle’s first four years. Control then was split for two years before Democrats enjoyed their brief unfettered reign. Going back further, to 1995, Republicans in Wisconsin controlled at least one of the three power spots every year until 2009. The kind of single-party dominance that Walker claimed Democrats have enjoyed for many years is rare in recent Wisconsin history. Walker, though, is now in year five with Republicans gripping all three levers of authority at the Capitol. Our rating Walker said Minnesota’s ""advantage"" has been having ""Republicans in charge of at least one part of government"" for all but two years, while Wisconsin Democrats ""for many years"" controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship before 2011. In making the comparison, though, he overstates how long the Democrats had total control in Wisconsin. It was for a two-year period, before he took office and Republicans won complete control. The Republicans have had that status more than twice as long as the ""many years"" Walker said Democrats did.

In an Oct. 1, 2013 speech to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County executive had plenty more for the list. ""We’re second only to Boston in college students per capita,"" Abele said. ""We have low labor turnover, low absenteeism, low loan default, incredibly high volunteerism, and some industries that are placed in really strategic places."" All sounds great. But what about those college students? In April of 2013, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee metropolitan area ranks about average in the share of residents with college degrees. All told, 31.4 percent of adults have degrees. But the area has more than 100,000 college students, from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to Marquette, Cardinal Stritch to Carroll, Alverno to the Milwaukee School of Engineering, the tech colleges and for-profits such as Bryant & Stratton College and DeVry University. The list goes on. Is it possible that the area ranks behind only Boston as a student hub? When we asked Abele for backup, his office said he was referring to 1996 data cited in a McGill University study of student concentrations in the 30 largest metro areas in the United States and Canada. However, Abele could not locate the actual study, which involves data from 17 years ago. We couldn’t either, nor could McGill officials. The closest we found was a Journal Sentinel story from 2000, when the study came out. It said the McGill study ranked the Milwaukee metro area sixth overall and fifth among U.S. metros in college students per capita. Boston was first in the United States (though it trailed Montreal in North America), followed by Denver, Minneapolis-St.Paul and Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News. So, Milwaukee certainly ranked high, but Abele’s memory was off on Milwaukee’s specific rank. Around the same time, the Atlanta Regional Council for Higher Education found that Milwaukee ranked 13th among the top 50 largest metro areas. In any case, both studies are very outdated, and Abele’s claim was that Milwaukee ranks that high today. Here is a look at some more recent research: Middle among mid-size metros: Milwaukee ranked in the middle -- 16th of 30 -- among ""mid-size metros"" for student concentration in the 2013-’14 version of the American Institute for Economic Research’s annual ""College Destinations Index."" When looking at 229 metro areas with more than 15,000 students, Milwaukee ranked 134th in student concentration, the group’s spokesman Jon Sylbert said, quoting from statistics set for official release in late 2013. Abele, of course, could not have seen these rankings because they were not public. But last year’s AIER study was much the same story, ranking the Milwaukee metro area 14th among mid-size metros, and 123rd in the broader group. The latest AIER study used 2011 US Census data on enrollment. The Census defines college students as people attending a 4-year or 2-year college, university, or professional school, full time or part time, in courses that may advance the student toward a recognized college or university degree. Middle among top metros: Milwaukee ranked 23rd among the top 50 metro areas for student concentration, according to Kevin Stolarick, research director at The Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto. San Diego led, followed by Austin, Sacramento, Boston and San Jose, said Stolarick, who has studied student concentration and is a colleague of demographics expert Richard Florida. He also uses census data and definitions, but measures the number of college students against only the 15 and older population of an area. More broadly, Stolarick found that Milwaukee ranked 153rd of the 374 largest metro areas and 269th among 955 metros and smaller areas. So, the current research puts Milwaukee pretty far down the list. Behind the numbers Obviously such rankings can change depending on whether you include small ""college towns"" such as Ames, Iowa, home to Iowa State University, which had the highest student concentration according to the AIER study. The 2000 McGill study -- the one that cannot be located -- sought to eliminate those small college towns from the equation. But even if you take that approach with the more recent data, the Milwaukee metro area was nowhere near the top in concentration of students even among very large metro areas. For example, using the data from AIER, Milwaukee trails Boston, Miami, Richmond, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Raleigh, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego and others. So, what to make of the McGill study cited by Abele, and this area of research in general? Even Mark Michaud, an official in the office at McGill University that produced the study cited by Abele, urged caution. He told us he would question any rankings claims of this nature ""since all it takes is some creative definition for either the numerator (who exactly are college students?) or the denominator (what exactly is a city’s population?)."" Abele’s office also cited media accounts of growth in the number of college graduates moving to Milwaukee. But that doesn’t bear on Abele’s claim about current student enrollment. Our rating Abele said, ""We’re second only to Boston in college students per capita."" The county exec relies on decade-and-a-half-old data from a study that is no longer available and, in any event, does not back up his claim. A second dated study we found from 1996 put Milwaukee at 13th of 50. More recent research ranks the area far from the head of the class. We rate his claim False.",None,Chris Abele,None,None,None,2013-10-27T05:00:00,2013-10-01,['Boston']
142,pomt-12261,"Giving a committee chair’s stipend in the New York State Senate to another member of that committee ""has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades.""",false,/new-york/statements/2017/jul/10/diane-savino/stipends-vice-chairs-state-senate-new-practice-not/,"A recent uproar in Albany centered on how eight New York state senators, since 2015, have been paid stipends worth thousands of dollars for committee chairmanships they do not hold. Diane Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, called the practice business as usual in the Senate. ""In Albany there seems to be an obsession with something that has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades,"" Savino said in an interview on NY1, Charter's 24-hour news channel in New York City. Is Savino right that this has been going on for decades? How senators are paid Each Senate leadership position includes a stipend on top of a senator’s $79,500 salary. Stipends range from $9,000 for lower leadership posts to the $41,500 stipend collected by Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan. Committee chairs receive stipends. Vice chairs do not. A senator can receive only one stipend. Senate staffers send documents to the New York State Comptroller’s Office each year listing the leadership position for which each senator should be paid his or her stipend. PolitiFact New York obtained the documents through Freedom of Information requests for each year starting in 2006. The Comptroller’s Office keeps the documents for only five years, so it provided documents from 2012 to this year. The Senate provided documents from 2006 through 2011. The documents show the practice of giving a committee chair’s stipend to a different member of that committee did not start until 2015. The stipends went to the chairs from 2006 through 2014, unless the chair was paid for a different leadership position. The chair’s stipend was not paid to anyone in those cases. Two lawmakers were paid for committee chairmanships they did not hold in 2015 and 2016. Sen. David Valesky was paid the $15,000 stipend of Health Committee Chairman Kemp Hannon. At the time, Hannon collected a $25,000 stipend as assistant majority leader on conference operations. Sen. Andrew Lanza was paid the $18,000 stipend of Codes Committee Chairman Michael Nozzolio, who received $22,000 as the Senate’s majority whip. Valesky and Lanza were listed as vice chairs of the committees. The practice widened in 2017, when six senators were paid for chairmanships they did not hold. Each, except Sen. Patricia Ritchie, was listed as vice chair of the respective committee. Savino received the $18,000 stipend of the Codes Committee chair this year. Lanza, who now chairs the Codes committee, received a $19,500 stipend as assistant senate majority whip. Ritchie, who chairs the Agriculture Committee, was instead paid the Health Committee chair’s stipend this year — a $2,500 increase. Ritchie is listed as deputy vice chair of the Health Committee. Sen. Thomas O’Mara was paid $15,000 as vice chairman of the Transportation Committee. O’Mara otherwise would have received a $12,500 stipend as the Environmental Conservation Committee chairman. Sen. Patrick Gallivan of Elma received $18,000 as vice chairman of the Education Committee, $5,500 more than he would have been be paid for chairing the Crime Victims, Crime, and Correction Committee. Sen. Pam Helming would have received a $12,500 stipend as vice chairwoman of the Crime Victims Committee, the amount Gallivan would have been paid had he not collected the $18,000 from his Education Committee post. Helming decided not to accept the payment. Sen. Jose Peralta, in a twist, took a pay cut. He was paid $12,500 this year as vice chairman of the Energy and Telecommunications Committee. Documents show he was paid $14,500 as the Senate’s minority whip last year, a post he no longer holds. Savino’s view Savino’s spokesperson said the senator was talking about granting stipends to members in general, and not referring specifically to committee vice chairs taking the stipends left available by their committee chairs who took stipends from elsewhere. Stipends have been paid to members for decades. The Legislature started paying stipends to committee chairs in 1976. But Savino’s statement came in reply to an interviewer's question about the stipends going to vice chairs. Viewers who watched the interview could not be expected to understand her comment as her spokesperson said it was intended. Our ruling Savino said the practice of giving a committee chairman’s stipend to the vice chair in the State Senate has been ""a legislative practice for decades."" Records from the state Comptroller’s Office indicate otherwise. The practice did not happen any time in the last decade. It started in 2015. Records do not support Savino’s statement. We rate it False. EDITOR'S NOTE - UPDATE Savino's office issued a statement about our story after publication on July 10. ""It’s amazing that an outlet which calls itself Politifact could take liberties with the truth and distort my words based on their ‘perception’ of an interview. Perception is not fact it is opinion, and the truth is that the fragment they plucked from my full statement is as true today as it was when I said it: The practice of the Senate issuing stipends to senators has been a legislative practice for decades. I never said vice chairs were, though they are certainly entitled to under the legislative law. In fact, every senator in our house is entitled to one allowance including every senator in the minority,"" Savino said in the statement. For context, here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview we fact-checked: ERROL LOUIS: For over a week now we’ve been telling you about the controversy involving stipends paid to state senators for positions they do not technically hold. Critics have denounced the practice but Republicans and Independent Democratic Conference leaders say it’s much ado about nothing. My first guest tonight is one of those senators. Democrat Diane Savino is a member of the IDC. She represents parts of Staten Island and southern Brooklyn and she got her stipend as role of vice chair of the senate codes committee. Welcome to the program, thanks for coming back down from Albany. SAVINO: Thanks for having me Errol, how are you? ERROL LOUIS: Oh I’m very good thanks. Tell me what a Vice Chair does. What’s the idea? SAVINO: Well first I want to just reflect on how you opened this. For the past week apparently the Albany press corps has been obsessed with this. When you look at what’s happening in the world, it’s almost as if the world is going to hell in a handbasket. The president is on the verge of being accused of possible crimes where they’re talking about impeachment, the stock market is collapsing today, but yet in Albany there seems to be an obsession with something that has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades. And in fact when there was a question brought up about it, legal memos were presented and offered to the press to verify that was has been done has been consistent with legislative law and legislative practice for decades, the comptroller’s office verified that that is in fact in legislative law and has been practiced for decades. So, I am mystified as to what the obsession is. Our ruling does not change. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com",None,Diane Savino,None,None,None,2017-07-10T00:00:00,2017-05-17,['None']
143,pomt-07302,"""Wisconsin is one of the few states in the country that do not currently require a photographic identification"" to vote.",false,/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/18/terry-moulton/state-sen-terry-moulton-says-wisconsin-one-few-sta/,"As the Wisconsin Legislature took up a strict photo ID requirement for voting, Republicans responded to concerns that the bill was one of the most restrictive in the United States. Most didn't dispute that fact, saying it was a necessary anti-fraud measure. We previously rated as True a claim from Milwaukee Ald. Milele Coggs that ""In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation."" Republicans did, however, make several changes that put in doubt whether it's still the most restrictive, or just one of the most restrictive. But in the weeks before the state Assembly approved the amended measure May 11, at least one photo ID backer in the state Senate put Wisconsin’s status in a totally different light. (The Senate was poised to give final approval to the bill on May 19, 2011.) State Sen. Terry Moulton, R-Chippewa Falls, answered constituent concerns with a letter that made this claim: ""Wisconsin is one of the few states in the country that do not currently require a photographic identification."" We heard from two Moulton constituents -- Gail Halmstad of Chippewa Falls and Jim Dunning of Eau Claire -- who said they received those Moulton letters between late March and mid-April. Both said they question the need for a photo ID mandate at the polls. Others, including state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, have made similar statements. ""I think most people just want to get the issue off the table and say, yeah, we should have an ID in order to vote. Most states have an ID for voting,"" Darling told a WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) reporter for a May 11, 2011 story. Darling didn’t say ""photo"" ID, so her statement can’t be equated with that of Moulton. But that’s what the bill requires and what she supports, so her comment may have left the impression with viewers that she meant most states have photo ID for voting. Moulton’s statement was simple and straightforward. So is our evaluation, since we have been down this road before. The definitive source for up-to-date information on state-by-state requirements for voter identification is the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures’ online guide, ""Voter Identification Requirements."" So is it true that Wisconsin is one of the few states that lacks a photo ID rule for voting? Actually, it’s the opposite. Only eight states currently request or require a photo ID to vote, according to the group. A ninth state, Kansas, will require photo ID as of 2012, we found. (The Wisconsin law would take effect in 2012 as well, barring a court injunction.) Another 18 states require some form of identification, but it does not have to include a picture. That tally will move to 19 in July 2011 when Oklahoma election officials begin requesting photo ID, according to the group. These numbers could change more in the months ahead. According to Brennan Center for Justice research, 37 states including Wisconsin are considering or have considered voter ID and/or proof of citizenship legislation in recent months. But currently Wisconsin is in a very large group of states that do not require photo ID to vote -- not ""one of the few"" who do not. Most states do not ask or mandate photo ID. Moulton’s office told us they inadvertently erred in the constituent letter and have omitted the claim in letters that have gone out recently. Elise Nelson, an aide to Moulton, gave us a copy of the revised letter she said went out on May 10, and it does not include the earlier claim. But it does not correct it either, so recipients may still have the impression the earlier claim is fact. Nelson said she did not know where Moulton’s office came up with the original claim. The bottom line? As Wisconsin was on the verge of enacting a photo ID requirement for voting, Moulton said the state was one of only a few without one. But as senators prepared to cast their final vote, most states still do not require photo ID to vote. Moulton’s claim to constituents, as his office notes, was well off target.

144,pomt-07243,"""Most of your serial killers, most of your people who commit domestic violence, they start off by abusing animals.""",false,/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/31/ej-finocchio/rhode-island-society-prevention-cruelty-animals-ch/,"The Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wants the legal system to impose harsher sentences in animal cruelty cases. During a discussion on the issue on WJAR's ""10 News Conference,"" which aired April 24, RISPCA President E.J. Finocchio said animal abusers are allowed to plead ""no contest"" and make a donation to the court instead of paying a fine, a practice that allows them to escape a formal conviction. It's important to take animal violence seriously, he said. ""Animal cruelty and domestic violence go hand in hand,"" he said. ""Most of your serial killers, most of your people who commit domestic violence, they start off by abusing animals, the weakest of our society -- children, elderly, animals, women -- so there is a direct correlation statistically nationwide that animal abuse and domestic violence go hand in hand."" We were intrigued by the possibility that animals might be a sort of ""gateway victim"" for most domestic violence perpetrators or serial killers, or that animal abuse might be a harbinger of murder and domestic violence. When we asked Finocchio for supporting evidence, he sent us the society's winter 2009 newsletter, which mentioned five serial killers and the way they had harmed animals. He also suggested we check a June 2009 study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence that examined whether animal cruelty is a ""red flag"" for family violence (more about that later). In addition, we consulted with other experts. The consensus was that there is a link, but it's complicated. ""Animal abuse is strongly associated with a whole host of antisocial behavior running from violence against people to parking ticket violations. It lights up the board,"" said Arnold Arluke, a professor of sociology at Northeastern University. ""The study we did compared animal abusers to people who were not animal abusers. The abusers were five times more likely to have a history of violence toward people, four times more likely to commit a property crime and three and a half times more likely to commit a drug-related offense,"" he said. The problem, he said, is that animal violence ""is not really a strong predictor or causal agent [of violence toward people]. There's a lot of people who commit animal abuse who do not go on to commit any other violence."" Among those who do, the animal violence is usually ""up close and personal"" (such as when an animal is strangled), the animal is typically known to the abuser, and there has been more than one instance of abuse. ""But,"" said Arluke, ""most cases aren't like that."" In his statement, Finocchio talked about ""most"" serial killers and ""most"" people who commit domestic violence. Let's consider them separately. SERIAL KILLERS: We contacted Ann Burgess, a professor of psychiatric nursing at Boston College who coauthored the 1988 book ""Sexual Homicide: Patterns and Motives."" The book is based on interviews with 36 serial murderers. She and her colleagues found that 13 (or 36 percent) had a history of animal cruelty. ""So you can't say most,"" she said, referring to Finocchio's claim. ""The FBI did a study of serial killers and they found fewer than 50 percent had a known history of animal abuse. In fact, some were known as the animal lovers in the neighborhood,"" said Arluke. The idea of a link between animal abuse and serial killers ""becomes one of the expressions that people who champion [animal protection] like to throw around. It's smart politics because we don't want more serial killers,"" he said. ""But the minute you start to look at every instance of animal abuse as essentially predictive of every person who's going to be a serial killer, if that were the case, we would have tens of thousands of serial killers, and we don't, thank God."" DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATORS: Once again, there is good evidence that animal abuse and domestic violence go hand in hand. The question is whether most abusers harmed animals first. Surveys of women seeking help at domestic violence shelters have found that 46 to 71 percent report that their male abuser had harmed or threatened to harm a pet, according to the ""Red Flag"" study Finocchio referred us to, which was coauthored by Sarah DeGue of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and David DeLillo of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. People who engage in domestic violence are known to use pets to intimidate, coerce or control the victimized partner, DeGue and others told us. (In fact, Finocchio's organization serves as a safe haven for the pets of people victimized by domestic violence.) But women who end up in a shelter constitute a very select group. After all, they aren't the only victims of domestic violence. And such studies don't show whether animal abuse came first. DeGue and DeLillo said researchers, advocates and policy makers often assume that there's an overlap between animal abuse and domestic violence (including child mistreatment). Yet ""little evidence exists to support this contention."" In their study of 860 college students they found that ""the majority (73.2 percent) of family violence victims overall did not report any exposure to animal abuse."" So only 27 percent of the victims of domestic and/or child abuse had seen or engaged in animal abuse as well. That's far from a majority, even if you assume that, in all these cases, the abuser started off harming animals. ""I'm not aware of any reliable research studies that have examined animal abuse perpetration as a precursor to domestic partner violence,"" said DeGue, now a behavioral scientist in the division of violence prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We actually found a number of cases that were the reverse, where people were first violent toward people and then subsequently became violent toward animals,"" said Arluke. In short, there IS a link between domestic violence and animal abuse because violent people are, well, violent. If Finocchio had simply stuck with his assertion that ""animal cruelty and domestic violence go hand in hand,"" our ruling would be different. Instead, he made the provocative assertion that there's a progression of violence because ""most of your serial killers, most of your people who commit domestic violence, they start off by abusing animals."" The experts we consulted -- including one Finocchio sent us to -- said the best evidence shows that a majority of serial killers and domestic assailants do not have a history of animal abuse. The evidence supporting the idea that their first victims are animals is even slimmer. So the judges unanimously ruled that his statement is False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

145,pomt-08312,"State House incumbent Jill Chambers, R-Atlanta, ""personally profits from taxpayer money.""",false,/georgia/statements/2010/oct/30/georgia-house-democratic-caucus-behalf-elena-paren/state-house-candidate-parent-said-incumbent-profit/,"If you believe her foes, state House Rep. Jill Chambers is the candidate of your nightmares. Chambers ""sold out our families,"" according to a mailer by Democrats on behalf of challenger Elena Parent. The Republican lets businesses ""prey on consumers."" But wait. There's more. ""Even worse, Jill Chambers personally profits from taxpayer money,"" the mailer said. Profiting from taxpayer money? That claim begged for a fact check. District 81 is home to the Atlanta area's hardest-fought General Assembly race this season. Although the stretch of DeKalb County along Buford Highway leans toward Democrats, Chambers has managed to keep her seat since 2003. Parent, a political newcomer, could finally put the district in Democratic hands. The corporate attorney and former chief of staff for a state senator has strong backing and is not afraid of a fight. Mud is flying. Earlier this month, we checked out an attack by Chambers that accused Parent of taking money intended for the education of DeKalb children. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire. Now it's Parent's turn on the Truth-O-Meter. The Democrats' claim on her behalf that Chambers ""profits"" off of taxpayer money cites information from the General Assembly's Legislative Fiscal Office, which keeps track of member expenses. The mailer, received by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Oct. 13, elaborates: ""This year alone, Chambers billed taxpayers $9,000 for her expenses on days when the Legislature wasn't even in session ... If that wasn't enough, Chambers has charged taxpayers an additional $110,000 for her 'expenses' on top of her taxpayer-funded salary."" Parent's camp said they did not pay for the ad and did not coordinate with state Democrats who wrote it. They referred us to Don Weigel, director of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus, for additional details. He said they're not accusing Chambers of fraud. ""The point we're making is she is abusing the system,"" Weigel said. In addition to an annual salary of about $17,300, state law entitles members of the General Assembly to a per diem and mileage for their services. Most receive $173 per day plus 50 cents per mile. This money is for session days and out-of-session committee work. Chambers chairs the MARTA Oversight Committee, which oversees spending for the transit agency. She is also assigned to the Appropriations, Rules and Governmental Affairs committees. The Democrats' argument goes like this: The business Chambers ran with her now ex-husband selling art supplies to interior designers faltered in recent years and closed. She filed for bankruptcy earlier this month. According to Parent's camp, as Chambers struggled financially, the number of days she said she performed out-of-session committee work jumped from 17 in 2008 to to 43 in 2009, even though the full MARTOC committee met only a few times in 2009. Weigel said Chambers could have exaggerated the amount of work she performed to get more money. A document Democrats sent AJC PolitiFact Georgia laying out their argument said that they were unable to get the Legislature to produce records that say ""what, if any"" services she performed for the state. AJC PolitiFact Georgia came up with expense records stretching back eight years. To receive a per diem for out-of session committee work, legislators must file a voucher that names the committee and lists the dates of service and miles driven. To receive reimbursements for costs such as stipends for legislative aides, yearly parking at the Capitol, printing and post office boxes, legislators must submit vouchers and proof of payment. We took a look at those vouchers and receipts and compared them to figures Democrats provided us on Chambers' expenses. We will take the mailer's points one at a time: Chambers billed taxpayers $9,000 for her expenses on days when the Legislature wasn't in session This statement is misleading. So far this year, Chambers' actual expenses total $3,324.95. This is less than half the $7,000 that state law allows. She paid the money out of pocket and was reimbursed after the state received proof of payment. Chambers also reported she performed 42 days of committee work out of session for a total of $7,266 in per diem payments and $743.40 in mileage. This means that Chambers did receive money for days the Legislature was not in session. But so long as she did the work, state law says she is legally entitled to the money. We found no evidence that the number of days she reported was alarmingly high, or that she failed to perform a claimed day's work. A 2003 AJC investigation into per diem days found it was unusual for legislators to claim more than 50 days after the end of the legislative session. Chambers' 42 days included days of out-of session committee work during spring session breaks. According to that 2003 investigation, that year's MARTOC committee chair claimed he worked 99 days after the spring session. Chambers charged taxpayers $110,000 for her expenses on top of her salary This statement is even more misleading than the first. The paragraph that includes this sentence begins with the words ""this year alone."" Therefore a reader might easily think that Chambers billed the state $110,000 for a single year's expenses. A closer look at Democrats' data shows the $110,000 is a total for about eight years of service in the Legislature, not one. And the money was not solely for expenses such as legislative aide work or office furniture. It was the entire amount she had received from the state in per diem, mileage and expense reimbursements. Once again, state law entitles her to the money, so long as she does the work and makes real payments. We took a closer look at some of Chambers' vouchers. They included work while the Legislature was on break during session, and duties for committees other than MARTOC such as Appropriations and Rules. So even though the full MARTOC committee met only a few times out of session, Chambers was involved in other committees that also met. And contrary to Democrats' claims, Chambers' per diem days did not post an unusual jump during her financial difficulties. Their 2010 numbers excluded vouchers she filed after April 19. According to Oct. 21 Fiscal Office records, Chambers has worked 42 days outside of session this year -- one day less than in 2009. Since Chambers began as MARTOC chair in 2005, her days have typically hovered between 32 and 43, although they dipped in 2008 to 17. This means Chambers would have actually received less money when she needed it most. Given this information, the accusation that Chambers ""profits"" from taxpayer money is out of bounds. As Parent is a former chief of staff to a state senator, she and her camp should have known better. At AJC PolitiFact, the burden of proof rests on the accuser. Democrats have not proved Chambers exaggerated the amount of work she performed. Furthermore, the accusations are misleading. Parent's backers suggest Chambers is wasteful or dodging the rules. But her actual reported expenses in recent years have been less than half of what is allowed by law. Her per diem is set by state statute, and the days she claimed dropped when she could have used the cash. Given the flimsy backing to the claim, by the Parent camp's rules, you could say any legislator ""profits"" from her work if she claims per diem and mileage. We therefore rule this claim False.",None,Georgia House Democratic Caucus on behalf of Elena Parent,None,None,None,2010-10-30T06:00:00,2010-10-13,['None']
146,pomt-01339,Photos prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership.,false,/florida/statements/2014/oct/23/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-opponents-argue-denver-light-r/,"No Tax For Tracks, the grassroots group opposing the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative, says it has plenty of evidence light rail isn’t worth the cost. Just look at Denver, they say. Spokesperson Barb Haselden presented a series of photos during a debate with Greenlight’s Kyle Parks at the Stetson University College of Law on Sept. 29 (starting in the video at 27:40). The images showed a nearly deserted transit station, empty rail cars and a parking lot with almost no cars. ""I went to Denver for a transportation conference; they opened their light rail line 16 months ago. … When I got out and walked up to the front door to the brand new transit hub, nobody was there,"" she said, clicking onto an image of glass doors. ""I walked in the door that you just saw, main concourse at 10:30 Friday morning, nobody was there."" Empty staircases. ""Ticket windows: Nobody’s there. A few people waiting on a train."" Ticket windows without buyers. About a half-dozen people waiting on a platform. ""I got on the train, I quickly turned to the right to take a picture, and then I turned to the left."" A couple of passengers, then no passengers. ""But people say, well gee, maybe this is because it’s 10:30 and they had all gone to work,"" she said. ""Here’s the Park-n-Ride lot. Empty."" No Tax For Tracks is using this as proof that Greenlight Pinellas is a boondoggle, despite the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority and Greenlight boosters crying foul. The whole thing made PolitiFact Florida wonder, was her presentation truly worth a few thousand fares? On the FasTracks Haselden and No Tax For Tracks didn’t return our messages, but we figured out she attended the American Dream Conference from Sept. 19-21, 2014, sponsored by the American Dream Coalition, a vocal opponent of mass transit. Speakers conducted presentations with titles like ""Sustainable Suburban Development Can Defeat Social Engineering,"" ""Stopping Wasteful Projects Through Citizen Advocacy"" and ""Fighting Southern Florida’s Seven-50 Plan,"" referring to a public-private urban planning initiative in southeast Florida. The conference started with a tour on Sept. 19, including taking a train from downtown Denver’s Union Station to Golden on the region’s newest light rail line, the West line on the project called FasTracks. The public began using it in April 2013. It’s the first light rail line in the transit expansion approved by voters in 2004. The plan instituted a new 4/10 of a percent sales tax to add six new rail lines and bus rapid transit to the four lines in service since October 1994. The project was originally projected to cost $4.7 billion, but grew to more than $6 billion. These points are highlighted in a No Tax For Tracks video from the conference in which Natalie Menten, an elected board member for the Denver area’s Regional Transportation District and outspoken opponent of government spending, calls the entire project ""a failure, from start to finish."" Menten says the RTD public relations department would say the project came in under budget and ahead of schedule, and that wasn’t true. So we asked the district’s PR department. That’s not quite what they told us. Fare vs. fair It should be noted that yes, the FasTracks project’s budget did increase significantly. Several things occurred to (ahem) derail initial estimates. Pauletta Tonilas, senior public relations manager for the RTD, said some engineering and environmental solutions ended up being more complex than planned. There also was a spike in construction costs, as the prices for concrete, steel, diesel fuel, copper and the like went up. The Great Recession also disrupted the project, cutting into sales tax revenue after 2008. Another snag was a recent change by the Federal Railroad Administration requiring the use of bigger, stronger light rail cars on lines that moved along freight corridors, Tonilas said. With some creative financing and planning, the RTD finished the first phase, the 12-mile West line, eight months ahead of the working schedule. The West line averages about 14,000 trips per day -- that is, one person buying a ticket -- and should grow when other FasTracks lines open in 2016, Tonilas said. That accounts for about 17 percent of the 84,000 or so trips she said the entire light rail system gets per day, although that varies from month to month. The whole RTD system, including bus, rail and shuttle service, averages about 350,000 trips per day. To put that in perspective, Denver’s light rail consistently ranks in the top 10 light rail systems in the country, in terms of ridership. San Francisco’s streetcars get some 220,000 trips per day and Charlotte gets about 16,000, according to the American Public Transportation Association. Tampa’s streetcar line nets somewhere around 700 trips per day. Current projections for the 24-mile Greenlight Pinellas light rail line from St. Petersburg to Clearwater scheduled to open in 2024 estimate it will cost $1.87 billion to build, with about 17,000 riders per day by 2035. Back to the negatives Now, let’s get back to Haselden’s presentation, because there are some holes in it. First, the empty concourse. Scott Reed, assistant general manager for RTD communications, told us that was not a light rail station. It’s the renovated Union Station bus concourse, an underground station with light rail platforms above it. It’s still pretty empty, but that’s because ridership generally follows normal commuting times, Reed said. It’s no surprise the bus concourse and rail platforms were relatively empty at 10:30 on a Friday morning. Also, this was a westbound train headed to the suburbs in the morning, the opposite of normal commuting patterns. Haselden said no one was at the Park-n-Ride lot, but there’s a good reason for that, too: That was a parking lot for the Pepsi Center, the arena where the city’s professional hockey and basketball teams play, Reed said. It wouldn’t normally be filled on a Friday morning. Union Station doesn’t have a Park-n-Ride lot, Reed said, because it’s downtown. On at least one occasion, during an interview with Fox 13, Haselden was told the parking lot belonged to the arena, and the station said she had apologized. Our ruling No Tax For Tracks gave a presentation with photos they said prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership. After examining the presentation and Denver’s light rail system, we found the opposite. Not only are the photos misrepresenting the city’s mass transit, but statistics show the Mile High city has one of the more successful systems in the country. No Tax For Tracks may not approve of how rail is funded or operated, but using photos of one thing and saying it’s another nullifies the argument. We rate the statement False. Correction, Oct. 24, 2014: The story has been changed to reflect the Tampa streetcar line averages about 700 trips per day. The story previously had a different number.",None,No Tax For Tracks,None,None,None,2014-10-23T11:51:30,2014-09-29,['Denver']
147,pomt-06856,"""One of the biggest polluters in our country is the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.""",false,/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/03/jim-sensenbrenner/rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-milwaukee-metropolitan-/,"As a handler of human waste -- which it periodically dumps into Lake Michigan untreated -- the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District is less popular among some people than mosquitoes. But is the taxpayer-funded agency one of the nation’s largest polluters? On July 24, 2011, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., held a town hall meeting in Whitefish Bay, a Milwaukee suburb. A woman told the 33-year congressman she was ""appalled at the continued gutting of good government regulation and awarding corporations who pollute and not holding them accountable,"" according to Patch.com, a website that covers community news. Sensenbrenner said corporations are not the only ones to blame, adding: ""I get sick and tired of people saying that people are dumping sewage in our water when one of the biggest polluters in our country is the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District."" Sensenbrenner later called MMSD a ""disgrace,"" prompting applause as well as objections from the audience, based on a video clip posted on YouTube. But was the criticism on target? We’ll first point out that the sewerage district doesn’t generate the pollution in question; its job is to treat it. But sometimes the district is treated like other polluters. Federal and state regulators have taken action against MMSD and other sewerage districts when they dump more untreated sewage and storm water than their government permits allow. With $3.5 billion in capital assets to treat sewage and help control flooding, MMSD serves 1.1 million customers in 28 communities in southeastern Wisconsin. In 2011, the agency has budgeted $242 million in property tax money for capital projects and $82 million in sewer service fees for operations. Most people probably give the sewerage district little thought -- until heavy rainstorms bring news that MMSD has allowed millions of gallons of untreated sewage and storm water to flow into Lake Michigan and rivers. Large rainfaills lead to the so-called combined overflows because the agency closes the gates to its $1.3 billion deep tunnel when the accumulated water nears the tunnel’s 521-million-gallon capacity. The most recent episode occurred over two days in June 2011, when the sewer district said an estimated 170.5 million gallons of untreated waste water overflowed following storms. Overflows pose potential health risks. A 2010 study published by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Great Lakes WATER Institute and the Children’s Research Institute found an estimated 11 percent increase in the number of emergency room visits by children for acute gastrointestinal illness four days after rainfalls. That study cited untreated sewage releases as only one potential link to the illnesses. However, a 2007 Medical College of Wisconsin study concluded that such untreated waste water releases were ""potentially harmful"" because, in two of six releases examined, the number of children who went to emergency room for diarrhea ""increased significantly."" Sensenbrenner has been critical of MMSD in the past. In 2003, he lambasted the EPA for giving MMSD a ""clean water partner"" award not long after the sewerage district had been reprimanded for dumping. In 2005, when Sensenbrenner requested $68 million in federal flood control funds for MMSD, he emphasized that the agency had dumped ""billions of gallons of waste into Lake Michigan"" over the previous 10 years. We asked Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman, Amanda Infield, for evidence to back her boss’ claim about MMSD as a polluter and she he made three points. We asked Bill Graffin, MMSD’s spokesman, to respond and did our own research. MMSD’s dumping Infield said that from 1994 through late July 2011, MMSD dumped 24.2 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water into Lake Michigan. Graffin said that accurately quotes MMSD’s own statistics, which show that annual combined overflows have been as high as 4.38 billion gallons since 1994. That is down from overflows ranging from 7 billion to 9 billion gallons per year from 1990 through 1993. Graffin said three other Midwestern cities, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Chicago, all have larger annual overflows than Milwaukee, such that they are being forced to make major treatment upgrades because of enforcement action by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Documents show that MMSD’s counterpart in Cleveland, which releases nearly 5 billion gallons of untreated sewage per year, agreed in December 2010 to spend $3 billion; and the City of Indianapolis agreed in 2006, when overflows were nearly 8 billion gallons per year, to spend $1.73 billion. That figure was reduced in December 2010 to save Indianapolis $444 million. In Chicago, MMSD’s counterpart is under fire for its sewage dumping into the Chicago River. According to a New York Times article, in May 2011 the EPA ordered state regulators to impose stricter water quality standards on the river; environmental groups filed a lawsuit charging that Chicago’s waste water agency regularly violates the federal Clean Water Act; and an environmental group named the Chicago River one of the ""most endangered rivers"" in the country. Conversely, MMSD was last part of a legal stipulation in 2001. The agency finished making upgrades to its facilities required under the stipulation in 2010, Graffin said. Graffin also cited a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article on a 2006 study by the Sierra Legal Defense Fund, a Canadian conservation group. The article said Milwaukee was far from the worst polluter in the Great Lakes. The study gave Milwaukee a C-plus rating, ranking it in the top half of the 20 Great Lakes cities evaluated for sewage management. Milwaukee was at the top of all the large cities surveyed, according to the article. So, while MMSD sometimes does dump untreated waste water into Lake Michigan, Sensenbrenner provided no evidence comparing MMSD to other polluters. It’s also clear that in the Great Lakes area alone, Milwaukee is far from being the worst polluter. BP comparison Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman said the amount of waste water MMSD dumped into Lake Michigan in one week was 10 times the amount of oil spilled by BP in the disastrous Gulf of Mexico spill in April 2009. She cited a news report from WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) in Milwaukee that said 2.1 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water were dumped into Lake Michigan following storms that caused flooding in July 2010. That amounted to about 75 percent of the overflows for the year. The 2.1 billion gallons is more than 10 times the 170 million gallons of oil spilled by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. But measurements don’t tell the whole story. One important difference: What MMSD dumps includes contaminants, but it is mostly water; BP spilled oil. A presidential commission that investigated the BP incident said in a January 2011 report that the spill was the largest accidental marine oil spill in U.S. history. The spill was so massive, the report says, that it will take decades just to assess the environmental damage, leaving aside the tens of billions of dollars in economic damage caused. So, aside from noting the difference in volume, Sensenbrenner provided no evidence to establish that one MMSD overflow was somehow worse than what is regarded as one of the nation’s worst environmental accidents. Spoiled beaches Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman said southeastern Wisconsin has some of the most polluted beaches in the nation. She cited a 2011 report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental action group. The report labeled 13 beaches in seven states as ""repeat offenders"" for having high bacteria levels from 2006 through 2010. Two of the beaches were in southeastern Wisconsin, including one -- South Shore in Milwaukee -- that is in MMSD’s service area. The report does not mention the sewerage district but seems to implicate the agency, saying ""chronically high bacteria counts indicate that the beach water is probably contaminated with human or animal waste."" The Great Lakes WATER Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says, however, that sewage overflows are not the primary cause of beach advisories and closings. The main causes at many Milwaukee-area beaches are waste from gulls and storm water runoff, according to the institute. In addition, the EPA said in a 2007 report to Congress that sewer overflows were the source of pollution in only 3 percent of the beach advisories and closings in Milwaukee County from 2000 to 2004. So, like the other points, that one does not stand up to scrutiny. We wondered whether there were rankings of the nation’s worst water polluters, but Josh Mogerman, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he was not aware of any. We did find a June 2011 report about MMSD by the Public Policy Forum, a government watchdog and research organization in Milwaukee. The report focused on the sewerage district’s financial condition. But it also found that, according to national data, MMSD’s ""sewage and treatment capacity offers greater protection from sewage overflows than most other districts."" So where does all of this leave us? Upset about how much untreated waste water goes into Lake Michigan, Sensenbrenner called the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District ""one of the biggest polluters in our country."" He cited the amount of dumping MMSD has done, but provided no evidence that it ranks among the nation’s top polluters. To be sure, MMSD does dump untreated sewage -- along with collected rainwater -- in the lake when its system reaches capacity. But Sensenbrenner’s claim was one of magnitude, comparing the district to all other polluters nationwide. We found evidence indicating that MMSD is not even among the worst sewerage district polluters in the Great Lakes region.

148,pomt-04610,"The ""48, 49 percent"" that supports President Barack Obama are ""people who pay no income tax.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-voters-who-support-barack-obama-a/,"A surreptitiously recorded video of Mitt Romney speaking at a fundraiser stirred up the presidential race on Sept. 17, 2012. The video showed Romney saying that 47 percent of the American public are ""dependent on government,"" ""believe that they are victims"" and ""believe the government has a responsibility to care for them."" Romney also claimed that the 47 percent of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes are strong Obama supporters because they are so dependent on government benefits that Obama freely provides. ""There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,"" Romney said, according to the video leaked to the liberal magazine Mother Jones. ""All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. ""And I mean the president starts out with 48, 49 percent … he starts off with a huge number,"" Romney continued. ""These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn’t connect. So he’ll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean, that’s what they sell every four years. And so my job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the five to 10 percent in the center that are independents, that are thoughtful...."" Almost immediately after the video hit the news, we received a flood of requests from readers asking us to check Romney’s claims. In this item, we’ll look at whether the ""48, 49 percent"" that supports President Barack Obama are ""people who pay no income tax."" We should note that Romney, during a hastily called news conference in California, called his comments ""not elegantly stated,"" but he didn’t backtrack from their substance. What he said is ""a message which I'm going to carry and continue to carry, which is, look, the president's approach is attractive to people who are not paying taxes, because, frankly, my discussion about lowering taxes isn't as attractive to them. And therefore, I'm not likely to draw them into my campaign...."" In this item, we'll look at who pays taxes -- and who doesn't. Then we'll look at whether Obama supporters and Americans who don’t pay taxes are one and the same. Who pays taxes Romney’s figure is close to one from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that 46 percent of tax filers pay no income tax, vs. about 54 percent of tax filers that did have some federal income tax liability. Generally speaking, the groups most likely to have no tax liability are the elderly and the poor. Anti-tax Republicans tend to focus on the federal income tax burden because it helps make their case that the federal income tax burden falls disproportionately on the wealthy. Because there is a solid basis for this number, we’ve rated it True in the past -- at least when it is described correctly. That qualifier is important. While the 46 percent figure refers to federal income tax, federal income tax is not the only tax that Americans pay. It’s not even the only federal tax people pay. An additional 28 percent will at least pay federal payroll taxes, which funds Social Security and Medicare and is deducted from every working American’s paycheck. Most of the rest are the poor and elderly. So, Romney would have been right if he said about 47 percent of all Americans don't pay federal income taxes. But he went further, arguing that those 47 percent of Americans who don’t pay federal income taxes are essentially all Obama supporters. And the facts don't back him up. Obama supporters It's tricky to compare taxpaying status with presidential preferences, but there are enough data points that we can poke some significant holes in Romney’s argument. • Income levels. We compared Tax Policy Center data with a recent CBS News-New York Times poll. Among households with below $50,000 in income, 68 percent owed no federal income taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. The poll showed Obama led in this group, 58 percent to 37 percent. For households between $50,000 and $100,000, 11 percent owed no federal income taxes. Romney led in this group, 50 percent to 47 percent. And for households above $100,000, 2 percent owed no federal income taxes. Romney led in this category, 57 percent to 41 percent. So there’s a modest correlation between the likelihood of not paying income taxes and the likelihood of supporting Obama. But Romney vastly overstates the link. Obama has substantial support among households $100,000 and up, and virtually all of them pay income taxes. Put another way, Obama is expected to win millions of votes from people who do pay federal income taxes, and Romney is expected to win millions of votes from people who do not pay federal income taxes. • Senior citizens. Romney gets strong support from seniors. He led in the CBS-New York Times poll by a 53 percent to 38 percent margin, and a CNN and Opinion Research Corp. poll from around the same time had Romney leading among senior by a 53 percent to 45 percent margin. Yet being a senior is one of the biggest reasons an American would pay no federal income taxes. Among those who saw tax breaks wipe out their income-tax liability, nearly half benefited from a tax break targeted at senior citizens. • State by state data. The Tax Foundation has found some state-by-state patterns that are problematic for Romney’s claim. The foundation tallied the states that had the highest percentages of non-income-tax-paying residents. The 10 states with the highest rates of non-tax-payers are mostly ones that Romney has in the bag -- Texas, Idaho, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. And several states with the lowest rates are solidly in Obama’s camp, including Minnesota, Maryland and Massachusetts. Our ruling Romney said that the ""48, 49 percent"" that supports President Barack Obama are ""people who pay no income tax."" But the polls and income tax data don't back this up. Obama gets substantial support from people earning more than $50,000 -- and 90 percent of them, or more, do pay taxes. And Romney gets lots of support from seniors, many of whom have no income tax liability. We rate the claim False.",None,Mitt Romney,None,None,None,2012-09-18T18:07:22,2012-05-17,['None']

For instance, Trump said that hedge fund managers -- some of them the billionaire counted as ""friends"" -- are ""not paying enough tax."" He also rejected a flat tax, an idea supported by some Republicans, countering that progressivity in the tax code is important. ""As you make a certain amount of money, I think you should have to graduate upward"" in tax rates, Trump said. Then he shifted gears again, articulating a more traditional Republican argument in favor of lowering taxes. ""Look, we’re the most highly taxed nation in the world — that’s why taxes have to go down, business has to come back, jobs have to be back,"" he said. A reader asked us if the United States is the ""mostly highly taxed nation in the world,"" so we decided to check it out. Trump’s press office did not respond to an inquiry. We should note that a more specific claim would have been largely accurate. We have given a Mostly True rating to the claim that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. (The statutory corporate tax rate ranks as the world's highest, but widespread deductions and exclusions tend to lower the effective rate below the comparative level for other countries.) But Trump's comment doesn't cite the corporate tax rate, and he seemed to be discussing overall tax rates when he said the United States is ""the most highly taxed nation in the world."" When we asked tax experts what they thought was the best yardstick for comparing different countries, they pointed to two possible criteria. One was tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The other was tax revenue per capita. Both measures are calculated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 advanced industrialized nations. We found that for both measurements, many of the United States’ industrialized peers had higher levels of taxation in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available. Taxes accounted for about 25 percent of the United States’ gross domestic product -- but if that sounds like a lot, it was only enough to rank the United States 27th out of 30 countries studied. The five with the highest percentages were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Sweden, each of them with taxation accounting for more than 42 percent of gross domestic product. Only South Korea, Chile and Mexico had lower levels of taxation per GDP than the United States. When looking at tax revenue per capita, the United States ranks somewhat higher, but still far from the top. Taxes per capita in the United States totaled $13,482, according to the OECD data. That ranked 16th out of 29 countries for which data was available for 2013. The five with the highest per-capita amounts were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, with amounts ranging from $23,000 to $48,000. Eleven countries had per-capita amounts less than $10,000, including Hungary, Chile and Turkey, the bottom three on the list. While it probably makes the most sense to compare the United States to other advanced, industrialized nations, there is one additional data source that includes the full roster of countries -- the World Bank. In the World Bank’s comparison of 115 countries for 2012, the U.S. ranked 12th from the bottom in taxation as a percentage of GDP. Among the countries with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), some wealthy oil-producing nations (Oman and Kuwait) and handful of very poor countries (including Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). Bottom line: Trump is wrong by all the data sets we looked at. Our ruling Trump said the United States is ""the most highly taxed nation in the world."" Depending on the measurement you use, the United States is either in the middle of the pack or on the lighter end of taxation when compared to other advanced industrialized nations.

150,pomt-05024,"Says he ""never supported"" federal health care individual mandate.",false,/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/15/tommy-thompson/gop-wisconsin-senate-candidate-thompson-says-he-ne/,"Among conservatives, a hated provision of federal health care reform is the ""individual mandate,"" which requires Americans (with some exceptions) to buy health insurance. That sentiment has left Republican Tommy Thompson in a difficult spot as he vies with three opponents in the August 2012 primary for U.S. Senate. The former governor and U.S. health and human services secretary has made statements for and against the health care reform legislation that eventually became law. That led us to rate Half True a claim by the national Club for Growth, a conservative group, that Thompson supported ""Obamacare."" On June 13, 2012, two weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court declared most of the reform law constitutional, Thompson issued two Internet statements about the individual mandate. In one message from a Twitter account for his campaign, Thompson said he ""didn’t support the individual mandate."" And in the other tweet, directed at Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Matt Canter, he went further, stating: ""Can’t back down from something (i.e. the individual mandate) that you never supported, Canter."" Taken together, Thompson is claiming he ""never supported"" the individual mandate. Never is pretty absolute, so let’s check the record. Opponents’ evidence Arguing that Thompson did support the mandate, Canter cited a video clip released by the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth the day before the Supreme Court ruling. (While the national Club for Growth has repeatedly attacked Thompson, and is supporting Republican Mark Neumann in the Senate race, the Wisconsin chapter has not.) In the clip, Thompson speaks at a national health care reform forum at American University in Washington, D.C. At the April 2006 event, held more than two years before Obama’s election, Thompson refers to reform in Massachusetts, saying: ""You’ve also got to consider strongly -- and I happen to support that, what Massachusetts did -- and that is requiring health insurance, the coverage of health insurance. This is a little bit opposed to what Republicans really think or propose. But the truth of the matter is, just like automobile insurance, you’ve got to have coverage. And if you’re going to be able to cover the uninsured, you’re going to have to have some degree of a mandate to cover the uninsured."" Both Canter and Club for Growth also cited video of a University of Texas speech in February 2007 in which Thompson says: ""I, for one, believe the mandate for health insurance is all right. We mandate insurance for automobiles. You know you can’t drive in Texas without automobile insurance. You can’t drive in any state without automobile insurance. It’s a mandate, but it’s certainly something that we should discuss in this country, and I think that’s positive."" So, Thompson said he supported Massachusetts’ health insurance requirement and said such a mandate is ""all right,"" although both statements were made before Obama’s reform efforts were launched. Thompson’s evidence To defend Thompson’s claim, his campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, said Thompson ""is the only candidate who has testified before Congress against the mandates."" He cited a portion of Thompson’s May 2008 testimony to the Senate Finance Committee: ""I am not convinced that the individual mandate is the correct approach,"" Thompson said, according to a transcript. ""We have seen in Massachusetts that the individual mandate approach is not effective at covering the most vulnerable part of the population, that part of the population which needs coverage the most."" So, after the generally supportive statements in 2006 and 2007, Thompson in 2008, shortly before Obama’s election, indicated he did not support an individual mandate. Nemoir also cited an August 2011 report by the University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org, which concluded that Club for Growth had falsely attacked Thompson as a ""champion of Obamacare,"" and he provided statements saying Thompson opposes what eventually became law. But Thompson’s past or current positions on the overall reform are not at issue here. In our item about Club for Growth’s claim about Thompson, Thompson’s campaign noted that Thompson at a July 2008 forum on a ""universal mandate"" for health insurance said: ""I don’t want a mandate."" But moments later Thompson said: ""I’m not opposed to it, I just don’t think it’s the most practical way."" Our rating Thompson said he ""never supported"" an individual mandate. But while he is now an opponent of the health care reform law and its mandate requiring most Americans to buy health insurance, Thompson said in 2006 he supported a mandate and in 2007 said a mandate is ""all right.""

""When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets, the only time in your lifetime, Brian, that we've had four consecutive balanced budgets,"" Gingrich said. ""Most people think that's good."" We’ve checked this -- such as during the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa -- and never found it to be accurate. Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs. The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion. But that’s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House. It’s also worth noting that even the two balanced budgets for which Gingrich can claim some credit were collective accomplishments by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.

The alleged vehicle: a back-to-school speech given to the nation's students. Some of Obama's other political opponents echoed the charge, and principals across the country had to answer questions from parents about whether students were required to watch the speech. This year, Obama gave a speech to schoolchildren on Sept. 14, 2010, with little controversy. Like last year, he spoke of the necessity of hard work and a good education. But we were surprised by a dramatic change of position for Jim Greer, the former head of the Republican Party of Florida. Here's his statement from last year: ""As the father of four children, I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama's socialist ideology. The idea that school children across our nation will be forced to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president, is not only infuriating, but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans, while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power."" We fact-checked that at the time and rated it Pants on Fire. We found no evidence that Obama intended to address school children on public policy matters, much less socialism. All evidence pointed to a more generic speech on the importance of education, and that's what Obama delivered. Greer's position has entirely changed since then, and in more ways than one. Greer lost his party chairmanship in January 2010, and state authorities arrested him in June on corruption charges, alleging that he used a secret contract to send party donations to a consulting firm he owned. Greer now faces six felony charges, including fraud and money laundering. (PolitiFact Florida has detailed a timeline on Greer's departure from the state party.) Meanwhile, Gov. Charlie Crist -- who picked Greer as party chairman after Crist became governor in 2006 -- left the Republican Party in April to run as an independent for U.S. Senate. The party supports Marco Rubio, a former state legislator and speaker of the House, in that race. This year, to mark Obama's speech to students, Greer sent the following text message to Florida reporters: ""In the year since I issued a prepared statement regarding President Obama speaking to the nation’s school children, I have learned a great deal about the party I so deeply loved and served. Unfortunately, I found that many within the GOP have racist views and I apologize to the president for my opposition to his speech last year and my efforts to placate the extremists who dominate our party today. My children and I look forward to the president's speech."" We called the Republican Party of Florida and asked them about Greer's statement, but they declined to comment. That could be because Greer earlier this year filed a lawsuit against the party for failing to pay him severance of $124,000, plus health care. Just this past weekend, party officials said they were contemplating their own lawsuit against Greer and Crist for misspending party funds. So Greer is no longer head of the party and repudiates his own statements from a year ago. Could Greer's new view on Obama's school speech be just another stick-in-the-eye to the people who kicked him out of his job? Sure. Greer sent a letter to Crist last month asking for his campaign contributions back, because Greer said he needs the money to defend himself. In the letter, he blasted state party leaders, some by name, saying they ""are simply liars, racists, and extremists ... the current bunch that are running the show will stop at nothing to cover for their own misdeeds.""

But we can't resist using our Flip-O-Meter to record such a complete reversal of position. Arlen Specter, the senior senator from Pennsylvania, was a moderate Republican, and one of only three Republican senators to vote for the economic stimulus bill that passed in February 2009. But many moderates in Pennsylvania have jumped ship. In the 2008 election, about 200,000 Pennsylvania Republicans became Democrats, many so they could vote in the hotly contested Democratic primary between Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton. This meant that as Specter looked to re-election next year, his prospects for beating a more conservative challenger — Pat Toomey, a former congressman who headed the free-market, antitax Club for Growth — were looking pretty bad. Yet Specter had ruled out switching parties, until ... Well, let's look at the evidence. Specter, in an interview with The Hill on March 17, 2009: ""I'm staying a Republican because I think I have a more important role to play there,"" he said. ""I think each of the 41 Republican senators, in a sense — and I don’t want to overstate this — is a national asset,"" he said, ""because if one was gone, you'd only have 40, the Democrats would have 60, and they would control all of the mechanisms of government."" Specter, in a news conference on April 28, 2009: ""In the course of the last several months since the stimulus vote, I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls, and have found that the prospects for winning the Republican primary are bleak. I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate ... . But I'm prepared today take on all comers — all comers — in a general election. And therefore, I have decided to be a candidate for re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary.""

Such was the case when we saw MSNBC host Keith Olbermann attacking Newt Gingrich, a Republican who was House speaker in the 1990s. ""Imagine being Newt Gingrich and looking into that mirror this morning and seeing that vast terrain of hypocrisy looking right back at you,"" Olbermann said on April 27, 2009. At issue: Gingrich's comments on torture. Olbermann said Gingrich was being hypocritical because his 2009 comments on interrogations conducted by the United States on terrorist extremists were not consistent with his comments from 1997 on torture in China. Gingrich then: In 1997, Gingrich was House speaker when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States. Gingrich was concerned about the persecution of religious minorities in China, and broached the topic in a meeting with Jiang. He then released a statement about the meeting: ""Republican leaders made explicitly clear our unwavering commitment to human rights and individual liberty. I believe it was vitally important that we used this opportunity to address the basic lack of freedom — speech, liberty, assembly, the press — in China. ... As I said in China this spring, there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family of man. There is no place for torture and arbitrary detention. There is no place for forced confessions. There is no place for intolerance of dissent. ""While we walked through the Rotunda. I explained to President Jiang how the roots of American rule of law go back more than 700 years, to the signing of the Magna Carta."" Gingrich now: Gingrich appeared on the Fox News Channel show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren on April 26, 2009, and said he wasn't sure whether waterboarding was torture. ""I honestly don't know,"" Gingrich told Van Susteren. ""I think it's debatable. Lawyers I respect a great deal say it is absolutely within the law; other lawyers say it absolutely is not in the law."" Whether it's considered torture or not, Gingrich said waterboarding was ""something we shouldn't do."" Gingrich explained that it might be warranted in extreme situations. ""I am exactly where Sen. (John) McCain was. Sen. McCain said there are very rare circumstances where extreme measures should be used. And those circumstances should be personally signed by the president as commander in chief. And a good example is if you pick up somebody who has planted a nuclear weapon in Washington or New York or Los Angeles or Atlanta and you're trying to find out in the next three hours, where is the nuclear weapon, the president of the United States may well authorize remarkably tough measures because 100,000 or a half million lives are at stake."" (Finally, we should note that Gingrich's view that torture is sometimes acceptable is shared by many Americans. A recent Pew poll found that only 25 percent of respondents said that torture is ""never"" justified. Seventy-one percent felt that torture was justified rarely, sometimes or often.) So, to measure the flip-flop: Gingrich in the past took a more absolute posture on prisoner treatment, saying that ""there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family of man."" Now he appears to say that it is okay in extreme cases. If Gingrich had argued, like former Vice President Dick Cheney has, that ""enhanced interrogation"" is an effective technique and should be used without hesitation, we would be inclined to give him a Full Flop rating. But Gingrich seems to say that torture should be used only in special cases. So we'll give him a Half Flip.",None,Newt Gingrich,None,None,None,2009-04-28T19:49:06,2009-04-24,['None']
155,pomt-12447,"""If you’re getting your insurance through (your employer), nothing changes"" under Trumpcare.",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/11/rod-blum/iowa-gops-blum-gets-it-wrong-acha-effect-employer-/,"Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, faced a feisty crowd at a high school gymnasium in Dubuque when voters in his district pressed him on his vote for the House Republican health care bill, the American Health Care Act. Blum aimed to put the bill’s changes into perspective. ""This bill, Trumpcare — whatever you want to call it — is about the individual market only,"" he said May 8. ""That’s 12,000 people in my district. So if you’re in the group health insurance program through your employers, if you’re getting your insurance through the group health insurance, nothing changes."" In this fact-check, we look at whether the House GOP measure changes nothing in employer-based plans. In reality, the bill does change the rules in a couple of ways that could affect employer plans. But the impact is far from certain. Core benefits One of the changes has to do with a key amendment authored by Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J. It gives states the option to pick their own list of ""essential health benefits,"" the services that every plan must provide. Under the Affordable Care Act, that list includes 10 services, from hospitalization to prescription drugs to pediatric care and more. Under the American Health Care Act, states could apply for waivers to drop some items from that list. Some common examples are maternity care or mental health, services that weren’t always part of insurance plans before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Blum’s spokesman Paul Smith told us it is wrong to focus on the MacArthur waivers. Blum ""was speaking about the large-group market, not the small-group market where the MacArthur waivers could potentially apply,"" Smith said. Smith is correct that the amendment only addresses the individual and small-group markets. But that doesn’t settle the question. First, Blum spoke about employer-based insurance generally. The distinction between small- and large-group plans might have been lost on his audience. Yet even if he was thinking about large employer plans, which cover about 110 million people nationwide, health law analysts say the Republican bill could touch those plans and those people, too. The link between the list of benefits and financial protection The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has two financial cushions for people. It bans annual and lifetime limits on coverage and requires insurance companies to put a cap on how much a person needs to pay out-of-pocket. In theory, no matter how big the medical bills get, they won’t drive someone into bankruptcy. The important thing is, both protections apply only to services on the essential benefits list. There’s another wrinkle. Companies that offer insurance through a large-group or a self-insurance plan are not required to provide every service on the essential benefits list, but for any item on that list that they do offer, those financial protections kick in. With that, we get to the significance of the MacArthur amendment. No one knows how many states will want to trim the essential benefits list, but the possibility could create some new options for the larger plans. ""Employers could choose to base the plans they offer on a definition of essential health benefits that is considerably weaker than the current one,"" Matt Fiedler, a health studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, said. Fiedler said any service not on a state’s list is not subject to the financial protections of no yearly or lifetime limits. Health law professor Allison Hoffman at UCLA gave the hypothetical case of maternity and newborn care. ""If the American Health Care Act becomes law, a state might define essential health benefits not to include maternity and newborn care,"" Hoffman said. ""Then, an employer could once again cap them."" Neither Fiedler nor Hoffman said that this would definitely happen; only that it could happen. Thomas Miller, a health law fellow at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, doesn’t argue the point. But Miller does downplay the significance. ""It's not unusual for the first round of voting on bills with recently revised amendments to fail to connect and integrate fully with pre-existing law,"" Miller said. He described this intersection between the MacArthur amendment and current regulations, an ""indirect bankshot"" that has nothing to do with the amendment’s purpose or intent. Miller and Fiedler said the problem could be avoided through new regulations. End of the employer mandate Under the American Health Care Act, no one must buy insurance, nor do employers have to offer it. Fiedler called this change ""clear and unambiguous."" ""The Congressional Budget Office projected that there would be a change in behavior,"" Fiedler said. The CBO didn’t look at the individual and employer mandates separately, but in its initial assessment of the House Republican bill, it said eliminating both would ""substantially reduce the number of people with health insurance coverage."" Miller noted that since large employers regularly offer insurance in order to compete for workers, keeping or ending the mandate would make little difference. Our ruling Blum said for people who get their insurance through their employer, the American Health Care Act changes nothing. The experts we reached said that there actually is a way that the GOP bill could affect employer plans. States could decide to trim the list of essential health services. Employers could still offer a fuller range of services, but the extra ones wouldn’t be subject to the rules that protect households against massive medical bills. No expert said this was certain to happen. Right now, it is a legal possibility. The end of the employer mandate also changes the rules for large employers, ending penalties for those that don’t offer insurance. But for different reasons, the impact is uncertain. Blum's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. We rate it Half True.

Marco Rubio portrayed Hillary Clinton as lying about the circumstances of the Benghazi attack when she said the attacks were the result of an anti-Muslim video instead of al-Qaida-like terrorists. ""There was not a single person on the ground in Benghazi who believed that it was a spontaneous uprising,"" he said in an interview on CNN on Oct. 29, 2015. CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Rubio how it could be a lie if the CIA told Clinton it was due to a demonstration. Rubio replied: ""She consistently, privately told people, over and over again, including in the early aftermath of it, that this was led by al-Qaida-like elements. There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on, irrespective of what the administration is telling you now."" We wanted to fact-check what Rubio said about what the CIA understood, drawing on the seven congressional investigations that followed, as well as news articles provided by Rubio and testimony by officials that the Clinton campaign sent us. What we found is a very murky situation. It seems like there were indications early on that the attacks were not the result of simple protests. But also early on, some in the government did seem to think that demonstrations over the video were a factor. That constitutes something of a ""shred,"" contrary to what Rubio said. Timeline of reports about what prompted the attacks To try to sort out the evidence, we created a timeline to show when information was shared about the reason for the attacks. (Other media have created their own timelines, including Factcheck.org and the Washington Post’s The Fact Checker.) Sept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks. Sept. 11, 2012: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta met with Defense Department officials a couple hours after the attack ""to discuss the Benghazi attack and other violence in the region in reaction to the anti-Muslim video,"" according to a report from the bipartisan Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Several officials later told this committee that they believed it was a terrorist attack immediately or almost immediately. Sept. 11, 2012: Clinton issued a statement that didn’t indicate a cause for the attack but said, ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet."" At 11:12 p.m. Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying the attack was conducted by an al-Qaida like group. Another email revealed that Clinton, during a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks. However, 24 hours after taking responsibility for the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia retracted the claim. Sept. 11, 2012: Two alerts were issued by the State Department Operations Center to administration officials, according to the House Republican Conference report. The first said the U.S. facilities were under attack, while the second linked the attacks to Ansar al-Sharia. Neither alert mentioned a protest related to the video. Sept. 12, 2012: In the first CIA assessment of the attacks, the CIA said ""the presence of armed assailants from the incident’s outset suggests this was an intentional assault and not the escalation of a peaceful protest."" According to the bipartisan House Intelligence Committee report, the CIA later said the initial assessment lacked supporting evidence and was subsequently left out of reports. Meanwhile, analysts ""received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi."" Fourteen of those reports were issued from the Open Source Center (a CIA intelligence center), while the rest came from the CIA, the Defense Department and the NSA. However, the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found issues with the reports because they included information from early news reports, not just original intelligence. The reports were also based on intercepted communications and informants’ tips, according to the New York Times. Sept, 12, 2012: President Barack Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden, said, ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation."" While he didn’t refer to the video directly, Obama did say, ""We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others."" Sept. 15, 2012: The CIA’s chief of station in Tripoli wrote an email to the then-deputy director of the CIA saying that the attacks were ""not an escalation of protests."" The intelligence community ""also had information that there were no protests outside the Temporary Mission Facility prior to the attacks, but did not incorporate that information into its widely circulated assessments in a timely manner,"" according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. Sept. 16, 2012: United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on five Sunday talk shows. She talked about the video several times and said, ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned."" She said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the current assessment was the attack was ""a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo -- almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video."" The administration was later criticized for the talking points fed to Rice in advance of her interviews. In an email from Ben Rhodes, the then-deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, one of those talking points stated: ""Since we began to see protests in response to this Internet video, the president has directed the administration to take a number of steps."" Sept. 18, 2012: The CIA and FBI reviewed video footage from the Benghazi compound that showed no protests preceding the attack. Sept. 19, 2012: Director of National Intelligence Matt Olsen said during a congressional hearing that the State Department officials in Benghazi died ""in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy."" Sept. 20, 2012: Clinton said during a press conference that ""the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it."" Sept. 21, 2012: Clinton attributed the attack to terrorism during a press conference: ""What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans."" Sept. 24, 2012: The CIA changed its assessment of the attacks after determining that no protests occurred outside the Benghazi facility before the attacks. Sept. 28, 2012: Shawn Turner, a spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence, issued a statement that officials initially thought that the attack was spontaneous but soon concluded that terrorists were involved: ""In the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. ... As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists."" Rubio campaign evidence As for whether there was never ""a single shred of evidence"" presented that the attack was spontaneous despite what Clinton said, a spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to news articles in conservative media about what Clinton and the former acting CIA director Michael Morell said about the attacks. For example, in an Oct. 23, 2015, Fox News report, Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods, who died in the Benghazi attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton on Sept. 14, 2012. The two spoke at a ceremony when the victims’ bodies were flown back to the United States. ""I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son,"" the entry said. In Morell’s 2015 book The Great War of Our Time, Morell wrote, ""Still others might have been motivated by the video -- although I should note our analysts never said the video was a factor in the Benghazi attacks."" Clinton campaign evidence Clinton’s campaign also pointed to statements made by government officials who described initial confusion. ""I think that the first week after 9/11, there was significant uncertainty about what had happened and disagreement among key people who shaped opinion,"" State Department Office Director for Maghreb Affairs William Roebuck told the Democratic Staff Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in August 2013. Adding to the confusion was that the Benghazi attack occurred around the same time as protests over the anti-Muslim video in Cairo. ""There was some confusion about have you had -- was this the same thing, were these two incidents the same, were they different?"" Roebuck said. ""The interagency was trying to sort that out. They were also trying to sort out the conflicting information from Benghazi itself. ... Like I said, there was a dispute among people who were looking very carefully at all of the evidence on the ground, and there was a legitimate disagreement about what had sort of been the precursor to the attack."" Our ruling Rubio said on CNN, ""There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on."" There was some initial confusion about what sparked the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. Although investigations showed that some officials thought it was a terrorist attack immediately, there at least appeared to be some question about whether the video could have played a role. Rubio exaggerates when he said there wasn’t a ""single shred of evidence."" There were several suggestions that it was because of a protest. However, he has a point that much of the early evidence pointed strongly to terrorism.

""Bill Clinton cut the military drastically,"" Giuliani said. ""It was called the peace dividend, one of those nice-sounding phrases: very devastating. It was a 25, 30 percent cut in the military."" This claim is similar to others made by Mitt Romney in campaign speeches that we have previously checked and found were misleading. In April 2007, Romney said, ""Following the end of the Cold War, President Clinton began to dismantle our military. He reduced our forces by 500,000. He retired almost 80 ships. Our spending on national defense dropped from over 6 percent of GDP to 3.8 percent today."" The two Republicans are correct that military forces were reduced significantly under Clinton. The active-duty military totaled 1.8-million at the start of his presidency in 1993 and declined to 1.4-million in 2000. They are also correct that the naval fleet shrank dramatically. The Navy had 454 ships in 1993, but as vessels were retired and not replaced, the fleet was down to 341 by 2000. But they are selectively choosing numbers that make it appear that the military cuts were Clinton's alone. In fact, the cuts were prompted by the end of the Cold War during the presidency of President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. During Bush's presidency, he and Congress agreed to a sharp drop in military personnel. Active-duty military declined from 2.2-million to 1.8-million. Total defense forces also shrank, from 3.3-million to 2.9-million. The Republicans are trying to portray Clinton and the Democrats as weak on defense and to make the peace dividend look like a partisan effort. But contrary to the Republicans' claims, the post-Cold War shrinkage of the U.S. military was very much a bipartisan effort. It began under a Republican president and a Democratic Congress and continued under a Democratic president and a Republican Congress.

158,pomt-14242,"In every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, ""there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first.""",half-true,/florida/statements/2016/apr/13/alan-grayson/us-rep-alan-grayson-downplays-potential-punishment/,"U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson waved off a recent congressional report on his alleged ethics violations, arguing that the findings mean he’s practically in the clear. The Office of Congressional Ethics on April 5, 2016, released a report recommending that a House committee keep investigating Grayson. The Orlando Democrat, who is running for Sen. Marco Rubio’s soon-to-open seat, has been accused of improperly managing a hedge fund, not disclosing all his finances and conducting business deals with the federal government that would be conflicts of interest. So far, the House has not formed a new subcommittee to keep looking into the allegations. Grayson said in a conference call with reporters that is a sign he likely won’t have to face serious repercussions. ""In every single instance where there's been any formal sanction -— an expulsion, a reprimand or a censure of any member — in every one of those cases since the Office of Congressional Ethics was established, there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first,"" he said. He added that if the House Ethics Committee doesn’t form one of these panels, it usually will dismiss the complaint. ""What this does very likely represent is the end of the road regarding this particular inquiry,"" he said. We wondered whether Grayson was right that formal sanctions have only followed the creation of an investigative subcommittee. We found that Grayson has a point on the most severe types of punishments, but it doesn’t mean investigations (or potential penalties) have reached ""the end of the road."" There may yet be mileage to cover here. House rules Let’s look at how ethics investigations work. The Office of Congressional Ethics is an independent body in charge of reviewing misconduct charges by House members and their staffs. The House created the office in March 2008 after criticism that its own self-policing wasn’t working very well, and the new office began reviewing cases in February 2009. The office investigates complaints, then makes recommendations to the House Ethics Committee. The committee can act upon the office’s reports, and still has the power to start investigations on its own. Grayson cited as ""formal sanctions"" — expulsion, reprimand and censure — but those are punishments that Congress rarely metes out, to begin with. Expulsion is what it sounds like: A member is removed from the House by a two-thirds vote. It has only happened five times in the history of the chamber, all before the Office of Congressional Ethics was created. The last time was in 2002, when Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, was expelled after taking campaign funds for personal use. Pennsylvania Democrat Michael Myers was expelled in 1980 for accepting a $50,000 bribe during the FBI’s Abscam sting, and three other members were kicked out after the Civil War started, for disloyalty to the Union. Next is censure, when a majority of the House votes to admonish a member’s behavior. Usually this includes a public shaming of sorts, during which the censured member must stand in the middle of the House chamber while a resolution is read aloud. The most recent example is Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., who was censured in 2010 for 11 ethics violations. Those violations included misusing his office resources to solicit funds and not paying taxes on a vacation home. It was the 23rd time a member had been punished with a censure. Rangel’s censure did have an investigative subcommittee in the House Ethics Committee, because procedure in this case required it. The same is true for the formal reprimand, also decided by House vote following an investigation. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report, ""reprimand"" and ""censure"" were essentially interchangeable until ""reprimand"" was defined as a lesser punishment in 1976. Unlike a censure, there is no public humiliation component of a reprimand. In 2012, California Democrat Laura Richardson was reprimanded for making congressional staff work on her campaign. Her punishment included a $10,000 fine. It was the 10th formal reprimand since 1976. We’ll note the Office of Congressional Ethics doesn’t factor in here, because the House Ethics Committee started its own investigation into Richardson, without a referral from the office. Again, the committee did empanel an investigative subcommittee, because that’s the procedure. Craig Holman, a lobbyist with government watchdog Public Citizen, said Grayson ""is painting a false picture"" of how members of Congress are disciplined. The formal punishments outlined above require an investigative subcommittee, but House rules outline scads of other punishments that can be levied. These other actions include fines, restitution, amending errant financial reports, removal from committees, loss of privileges or seniority or ""any other sanction determined by the Committee to be appropriate."" Holman said there’s been more than 20 of these cases since the OCE started. The House Ethics Committee is not necessarily bound to begin an investigative subcommittee in these cases. And even then, as sometimes happens in these cases, members can leave office rather than face an investigation (the committee only holds sway over House members). In 2011, Ohio Republican Jean Schmidt was ordered to repay $500,000 for free legal help without the House Ethics Committee starting an investigative subcommittee. She was not found guilty of knowingly violating House ethics rules. She repaid less than $50,000 before losing her re-election primary. There also isn’t always a set time limit for action, as Grayson implied. Instead of dismissing the complaint, the House Ethics Committee cited rule 18(a) in its conclusion to the OCE report on his case. That means the committee will keep the case open and may start an investigative subcommittee later. Sometimes that can mean much later. For example, the committee invoked rule 18(a) in August 2012 for Rep. Rob Andrews, D-N.J. An investigative subcommittee didn’t come until six months later, in March 2013. Andrews resigned the following year, with the investigation still open. We also found one other exceptional case that’s important to note. South Carolina Republican Joe Wilson was formally reprimanded in 2009 for interrupting President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address by shouting, ""You lie!"" That was through a resolution, not an ethics investigation. Wilson refused to formally apologize on the House floor after already apologizing to Obama personally. The Democrat-led House voted 240-179 for the reprimand over his ""breach of decorum."" The vote was largely seen as a political maneuver, not an outright ethics violation. Our ruling Grayson said that in every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, ""there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first."" The formal sanctions he cited were expulsion, censure and reprimand, all of which are exceedingly rare punishments. There are only three examples to pick from since the Office of Congressional Ethics materialized in 2009. In one case — the case of Wilson yelling ""you lie!"" — a formal reprimand came via a largely party-line resolution, not an ethics investigation, so no subcommittee was established. More importantly, Grayson omits that there are many other ways to discipline a member of Congress beyond formal sanctions. He also downplays that the House Ethics Committee kept his case open and could convene an investigative committee later.

159,pomt-14794,"Says there are ""ample means"" to ""tell when someone is a Christian in the Middle East ... by name, by where they’re born, their birth certificates.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/01/jeb-bush/identifying-middle-eastern-christians-can-be-harde/,"Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has said the United States should give preference to Christians fleeing the bloodshed in the Middle East. While many Americans and lawmakers view Muslims with suspicion, Bush argued this should not impede providing shelter to people of various Christian sects. This raises the question of how resettlement workers would be able to verify that the person who claims to be a Christian actually is one. In an interview on radio station WGIR in New Hampshire, Bush said there are many telltale signs. ""You can tell when someone is a Christian in the Middle East, I can promise you that,"" Bush said on NH Today. ""By name, by where they’re born, their birth certificates. There are ample means by which to know this."" We thought we’d explore the markers of Christian identity in the Middle East. The Bush campaign did not provide more details, so we turned to specialists in Middle Eastern religion and society. Lucas Van Rompay, a professor of religious studies at Duke University, said it would not be easy to tell. ""Some Christians do have specifically Christian names, but many don’t,"" Van Rompay said. ""In addition, the Qur’an knows the biblical names of Abraham, Joseph, Jesus, Mary, etc. so these names may be found among Muslims. The place where people are born may be relevant in some cases, such as some entirely Christian villages in northern Iraq, but most Christians live in cities or areas which have a mixed population."" Father Patrick Ryan, a Jesuit priest and professor of religion and society at Fordham University echoed those points, noting that many Arabs deliberately choose ""ambiguous names so you won’t be able to identify them religiously."" Ryan added that whether a woman is veiled is also unreliable. ""Many (non-Muslim) women in the Middle East cover their heads and necks,"" Ryan said. On the other hand, he noted that some Coptic Christians have distinctive tatoos. Many refugees do have their birth certificates, and ones from Syria list the person’s religion. Still, Van Rompay said truly verifying that a person is what he says he is can take a long time. Middle Eastern Christians tend to be well integrated into their communities. ""Even sitting down with someone and having a conversation about some of the tenets of Christianity or some basic prayers (Our Father, the Creed) would be problematic,"" Van Rompay said. ""Middle Eastern Christians are as diverse as Western Christians are, and some will be much more knowledgeable than others, and much more able to express themselves than others."" Our ruling Bush said there are ample ways to determine if a Middle Eastern refugee is a Christian and suggested that names, birthplace and birth certificate would be key. The experts we reached agreed that there are many ways to verify that a person is a Christian, but they warned that it would be far more complicated than Bush presented. For many Christians, neither their names nor where they were born confirms their religion. A birth certificate could prove helpful, but if one doubted its authenticity, a more arduous verification task lies ahead. Based on what the experts said, Bush misrepresented the power of the indicators he mentioned and the effort needed to go beyond them.

160,pomt-03233,"Says ""nearly half of Oregon's children are poor.""",half-true,/oregon/statements/2013/aug/16/jim-francesconi/are-nearly-half-oregons-children-growing-poor/,"With the State Board of Higher Education handing oversight of Oregon’s universities to independent boards, Jim Francesconi, one of the state board members, recently took to The Oregonian’s opinion pages to note a few of the issues the new custodians will have to deal with. Among them he said, and most importantly, education has to be accessible. ""Oregon,"" he wrote, ""must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor."" It was the line about the percentage of poor children in the state that caught one Oregonian reader’s attention. Oregon is hardly a rich state -- particularly when the national economy itself is down and out -- but nearly half? That seemed a stretch. We agreed with our reader -- it was worth looking into. Our first call was to Francesconi to see where he got his figures. He said the information came from a 2012 report by Children First for Oregon, an advocacy group. According to that report, ""nearly 50% of children are either poor or low-income."" Francesconi almost immediately realized his mistake. ""In retrospect, I wish I would have said poor or low income."" Though there may not be a difference to the average person, there is a distinction between poor and low income as far as the U.S. government is concerned. In order to qualify as poor, a family must make 100 percent or less of the federal poverty level. Low income refers to families between 100 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. So what does that mean in a practical sense? A family of four living in Oregon in 2013 would be considered ""poor"" if they make $23,550 or less a year. To be considered low income, a family would have to make between $23,550 and $47,100 a year. (For the curious, the National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University has a handy online calculator that can detail the poverty level for families of various sizes living in various states.) If you check the most recent Census information, you’ll find that in 2011 a little more than 23 percent of children (those younger than 18) in Oregon live in families at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level while another 21 percent live in low-income families. The figures are slightly higher still for young children, or those under 6 years old. Now, if we were just using the government’s definition of ""poor"" this would be a really easy False. As far as the U.S. government is concerned, about a quarter of the state’s children are poor, not half. But, at PolitiFact Oregon we strive for more context. Plus, it seemed to us that a family of four making $30,000 would likely feel pretty poor even if they didn’t meet the strict federal definition. So, we placed a couple calls to various non-partisan poverty centers around the nation and spoke with some experts. First up was Jennifer Romich, a professor at the University of Washington and founding affiliate of the West Coast Poverty Center. Using the federal poverty level as a strict line of who is poor and who is not can be problematic, she told us. ""The federal poverty line is widely seen as too low,"" Romich said. ""Among folks who spend their lifetime measuring poverty, they can agree that the current measure is problematic."" It doesn’t, for instance, take into account government assistance or tax expenditures. Plus, the measure, which rises with inflation, was developed in the 1960s and, aside from a couple small amendments, hasn’t been updated since. Romich explained that it ""was originally based on USDA reckonings that a family spends about 30 percent of their income on food which was true in the 60s but is not true today."" Nowadays, she said, health care and housing costs, for instance, are consuming much more of a budget. Either way, Romich said, families that are classified as low income are still going to ""feel economically deprived. … In laymen’s terms, you'd think of this as unofficially poor or close to poverty."" Another expert, this time from Columbia University, agreed. ""I think that many low-income families who are above the poverty line, but not much above it, are struggling a great deal with paying bills and finding childcare that is stable and affordable and paying co-insurance on medical visits and putting gas in the car,"" said Sheila Smith, who oversees the early childhood program at the National Center for Children in Poverty. ""We like to think that families who are above that threshold of the official poverty line are doing OK. But we know, in fact, that they ... are struggling in many ways."" Smith said she and her colleagues at the poverty center look at whether states are actively promoting the needs of low-income residents, they often put the benchmark at 200 percent of the federal poverty level. For instance, does the state set the income eligibility for child care subsidies at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. (The cut off in Oregon is 185 percent.) ""Families who are at or above 200 percent of the FPL,"" Smith explained, ""still really need that support for income stability."" So what is an appropriate way to determine what poverty is and who feels it? Romich pointed us to the work of a colleague who measures poverty with a ""Self-Sufficiency Standard."" Essentially, how much would various types of families living in various parts of the country have to make to meet basic needs. Diana Pearce, the mind behind the standard describes how it works in an Oregon-specific report from 2011: ""The Self-Sufficiency Standard is a measure of economic security that is based on the costs of the basic needs for working families: housing, child care, food, health care, transportation, and miscellaneous items as well as the cost of taxes and the impact of tax credits. In 2011, Pearce determined that a family of four -- with one school-age child and one preschooler -- living in Multnomah County would have had to make $52,989 in order to meet their needs. Now, remember, that’s how much the parents would have to make collectively. That amount would put the family at 225 percent of the federal poverty level. For what it’s worth, that family would also qualify for housing assistance. The National Center for Children in Poverty employs a similar metric for their ""basic needs budget calculator."" Their calculator, which calculates for families living in 2008, doesn’t have data for Oregon, however we ran the estimates for Vancouver, Wa., and Clark County. According to the calculator, a two-parent family with one school-age child and one preschooler would have needed to bring in $48,523 a year in 2008 to meet basic needs. So where does this leave us? Francesconi said in an opinion piece that ""nearly half of Oregon's children are poor."" In fact, if you use federal definitions for poverty, about a quarter are poor and another quarter are low-income. But experts tell us that families that are described as low-income still struggle to meet their basic needs and, for all intents and purposes, qualify as poor. Be that as it may, Francesconi was referencing a report that used the federal definitions. As such, his statement leaves out important details and we, too, think it would have been better to say ""poor and low income.""

161,pomt-00146,"Says Ron DeSantis has not revealed $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money.",half-true,/florida/statements/2018/oct/24/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-gillums-claim-about-desantis-145000-/,"Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and former Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis asked each other for receipts during a Florida gubernatorial debate: DeSantis asked who paid for Gillum's ticket to a Hamilton show, and Gillum called out DeSantis for travel paid by taxpayers. ""I would ask him, what happened to the $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money that he has yet to reveal?"" Gillum asked Oct. 24 during a WPBF 25 News debate. Here are the facts: DeSantis hasn’t released detailed receipts on $145,000 spent on travels, but he broadly reported the travel charges. Gillum cites Naples Daily News article as evidence Gillum’s campaign linked his claim to an Oct. 18 Naples Daily News article headlined, ""Candidate DeSantis won't disclose details of taxpayer-funded travel while in Congress."" The story says that DeSantis spent more than $145,000 in taxpayer money for travel as a congressman, including at least two trips to New York City to appear on Fox News shows. DeSantis was sworn into Congress in January 2013 and resigned in September to focus on his gubernatorial campaign. The story did not say DeSantis traveled to New York City to talk about his campaign — the known trips happened before he officially announced his candidacy in January 2018, although he had been expected to enter the race for months and President Donald Trump in December 2017 tweeted that DeSantis ""would make a great governor of Florida."" The story also doesn’t say that his spending broke House rules or laws. The crux of the story is that DeSantis hasn’t disclosed detailed travel receipts and that lack of information leads to uncertainty over how exactly he spent taxpayer money. ""Without receipts, it remains unclear how many trips DeSantis took at taxpayer expense to make media appearances. It's also difficult without those records to know how often he traveled at taxpayer expense to locations other than his Florida district or Washington office,"" the Naples Daily News story said. Funds come from the Members' Representational Allowance The money at issue comes from the Members' Representational Allowance, an annual allowance members of congress get to support their official and representational duties. The amount appropriated can vary per year. During his time in office, DeSantis’ allowance was more than $1 million but not more than $1.4 million. Authorized spending includes personnel salaries and benefits, travel, and office expenses. The funds cannot be used to pay for expenses ""related to activities or events that are primarily social in nature, personal expenses, campaign or political expenses, or House committee expenses,"" and members may be held personally liable for misspent funds or excess spending, said a September 2017 Congressional Research Service report. House members’ spending is published in a quarterly public report called Statements of Disbursements. The Naples Daily News analyzed reports submitted by DeSantis and found more than $1,000 spent on seven hotel stays since 2013, and 71 commercial transportation expenses totaling about $143,000. DeSantis did not provide to the news outlet details on where and how long he stayed in the hotels; nor receipts on the commercial transportation that would detail where, when, why or with whom he traveled, how many trips were by plane or train, and whether he traveled first-class or coach. DeSantis’ campaign did not respond to multiple PolitiFact queries. New York City trips to appear on Fox News The Naples Daily News identified travel expenses listed in DeSantis’ spending reports that matched the dates of at least two appearances on Fox News TV and radio shows, in July and October of 2017. DeSantis discussed issues of the day, including Trump’s policies. DeSantis by that point had not officially entered the race but was expected to join. DeSantis’ appearances on Fox News and Fox Business propelled him into the national spotlight and helped him win Trump’s endorsement. ""The once little-known congressman spent so much time broadcasting Fox News TV hits from Washington this year that he learned to apply his own powder so he could look as polished as he sounded,"" Politico reported. Stephen Lawson, DeSantis’ campaign spokesman, told the Naples Daily News that the trips to New York were ""official office travel that included official media appearances."" If a member of congress is invited in his or her official capacity to do an interview with any media organization, then use of the Members' Representational Allowance would be considered permissible if that was the member’s primary purpose for travel, said Courtney Parella, spokeswoman for the Committee on House Administration. DeSantis could voluntarily release records detailing his travels, but without itemized receipts there isn’t a way of knowing exactly how he spent taxpayers’ money, said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at the government watchdog group Public Citizen. The level of transparency as it relates to the release of detailed receipts varies among lawmakers, and they are not legally required to provide itemized receipts to the public, Gilbert said. Our ruling Gillum claimed DeSantis has not revealed $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money. DeSantis like other members of Congress received an allowance to cover expenses related to official duties. DeSantis has not disclosed — in detail — how he spent more than $145,000 in travel. But DeSantis has disclosed broad description for the expenses. Some reported expenses are listed as ""commercial transportation,"" but do not specify when or where the trip was taken. At least two travel expenses reported by DeSantis match the dates of 2017 appearances on Fox News shows. DeSantis’ campaign said those were official media appearances, because he was answering questions as a House member and had not yet entered the governor’s race. DeSantis is not legally required to disclose detailed reports of his travel. But a watchdog group said that without itemized it’s not entirely clear how DeSantis spent taxpayers’ money.

162,pomt-04022,"""Eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson's disease or glaucoma. They have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana.""",half-true,/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/03/patrick-kennedy/former-us-rep-patrick-kennedy-says-80-percent-peop/,"When former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-.R.I., launched a national group in January that opposes marijuana legalization, he also took issue with medical-marijuana laws that he says may have been well-intended but are misguided. And he questioned whether many of those who get permission to use marijuana for medical reasons are using it for legitimate reasons. ""Eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson’s disease or glaucoma,"" Kennedy said in a Jan. 8 story in The Providence Journal. ""They have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana."" (Kennedy’s group, Project SAM, which stands for Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argues that medical marijuana should only be used in non-smoked forms. ) Nineteen states and the District of Columbia allow its medical use, although it is still illegal under federal law. In addition to cancer and glaucoma, among conditions approved for medical marijuana use are HIV/AIDS, severe or chronic pain, persistent nausea and multiple sclerosis. We decided to examine both parts of Kennedy’s statement, beginning with the specific ailments people cite when seeking permission to use medical marijuana. Kennedy’s group referred us to Kevin A. Sabet, a professor and drug policy institute director at the University of Florida, who is a former Obama administration adviser on drug policy and a co-founder of Project SAM. He guided us to statistical links on the Project SAM website and e-mailed some figures related to medical marijuana programs in Colorado. The most recent Colorado data, as of Nov. 30, 2012, showed 3 percent of that state’s roughly 107,000 medical-marijuana patients reported having cancer and 1 percent had glaucoma, while Parkinson’s was not listed as a specific reportable condition. Ninety-four percent reported severe pain as their condition or one of their conditions. We checked with other states and found similar figures. In most states, including Colorado, medical marijuana patients reported more than one condition. In Arizona, where medical marijuana became legal in 2010, just under 4 percent of its 33,600 medical marijuana cardholders reported having cancer while 1.5 percent reported glaucoma. By far the most reported condition as of Nov. 7, 2012, was chronic pain at 90 percent. Nevada, one of the earlier states to legalize marijuana for medical use, adopting it in 2001, showed cancer cases were about 3.6 percent of reported conditions -- and glaucoma just under 2 percent, as of Jan. 8, 2013. Severe pain was overwhelmingly the number-one condition, hovering at more than 3,200 patients monthly.The total number of patients with medical-marijuana cards in Nevada, fluctuates; as of Jan. 8, it was 3,580. In Rhode Island, where medical marijuana became legal in 2009, 5.9 percent percent of those who received approval in 2010 cited cancer or cancer treatment, according to the Department of Health. Four percent of those getting approval in 2012 reported cancer. Glaucoma accounted for about 1 percent in both years while Parkinson’s is not listed as a separate qualifying diagnosis. Rhode Island, which has 4,860 people approved to use medical marijuana in its program, lists a wider range of diagnoses than several states we examined. Forty-four percent of Rhode Island patients cited ""severe debilitating chronic pain"" in 2012; 17 percent reported muscle spasms and 11 percent reported severe nausea. So the first part of Kennedy’s statement is right: Only a very small percentage of medical marijuana users cited cancer or glaucoma as their reason for using the drug; states we checked do not specifically list Parkinson’s, indicating few cite that ailment. What about the second part of the statement, that 80 percent of the people using medical marijuana ""have nothing you would associate"" with it? Sabet, from Project SAM, said Kennedy didn’t mean that the 80 percent have no legitimate reason to use the drug. But we think that most readers would understand that statement to mean 80 percent didn’t have an ailment generally associated with medical marijuana use. The facts show otherwise. As our research found, chronic pain, severe pain or severe debilitating chronic pain -- the most common conditions medical marijuana users cite -- are among several conditions or diagnoses listed by states as qualifying reasons for using, contingent on whatever standard a state requires applicant and physician to meet. The states with medical-marijuana laws require some form of sign-off from a physician on an application. Dr. Syed Rizvi, a neurologist at Rhode Island Hospital and associate professor at Brown University, said the patients he has approved for medical marijuana have included those with multiple sclerosis, are extremely disabled, maybe in extreme pain, and may not have responded well to other medications. He said he limits it to patients he has seen for some time, even years. Dr. Josiah D. Rich, a professor of medicine and community health at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School, said in his experience and from what he knows of other physicians, there are other legitimate conditions than those Kennedy cited that are legal in states for medical marijuana. ""Some of my patients who have AIDS … get very nauseous with the medicines they take,"" and therefore are approved to use medical marijuana, Dr. Rich said. Our ruling Former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy said that ""eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson’s disease or glaucoma"" and that ""they have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana."" Kennedy is right about the comparatively small percentage of medical-marijuana patients who use it for the conditions he named. But he is wrong that most of those using the drug do so for conditions not associated with it. In fact, states with medical marijuana laws allow use for chronic and severe pain -- the most common conditions cited by patients. Does everyone who has permission to use medical marijuana actually have a true medical need for it? We don’t know, but neither does Kennedy. We rate the statement Half True.

163,pomt-02512,"""Six people in Florida die as a result of (not expanding Medicaid) every day.""",half-true,/florida/statements/2014/feb/12/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-six-floridians-die-day-due-lack/,"Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, now running for his old position as a Democrat, has attacked Republican Gov. Rick Scott for his tepid support for Medicaid expansion last year. Scott had said he would support it, but he didn’t lobby for it, and ultimately the state Legislature rejected the expansion. In a Feb. 7 interview on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown, Crist said that means ""about 1 million of my fellow Floridians are not getting health care today, and I’m told by my friends at (the Service Employees International Union) that means that six people in Florida die as a result of that every day."" Is Crist’s diagnosis correct? Do six Floridians die a day because the Legislature rejected Medicaid expansion? The Health Affairs study Crist’s claim comes from a study released in late January on the blog of the health-policy journal Health Affairs. It was authored by researchers from Harvard University and the City University of New York. The researchers looked at states that had opted out of Medicaid expansion, including Florida, where about 1.27 million people would have been eligible. Researchers then used prior studies about the effects of expanding insurance to estimate a low-end number and a high-end number of deaths for each state that didn’t expand Medicaid. In Florida, the study concluded, the number of deaths would range from 1,158 to 2,221. The only state with more projected deaths was Texas. Crist arrived at his six-deaths-a-day figure for Florida by using the high end of the range cited in the study -- 2,221 deaths divided by 365 days a year works out to six deaths a day. If he had used the low-end figure, it would have worked out to three deaths per day. So what were the underlying studies? They were: • The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a comparison of about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. The study tracked factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, depression, and out-of-pocket medical spending. (PolitiFact has previously written about the mixed results of the health outcomes found in the Oregon study.) • A study by Harvard researchers Benjamin D. Sommers and Katherine Baicker compared three states that expanded Medicaid -- New York, Maine and Arizona -- with neighboring states that didn’t expand it. This is what the Harvard/CUNY researchers used to calculate their high estimate of deaths and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012. The sample consisted of adults who were observed five years before and after the expansions, from 1997 through 2007. • A study by Harvard researchers about health insurance and deaths. This produced the low-deaths estimate. The study was published in 2009 in the American Journal of Public Health; it followed indivduals over 16 years. (Two of the authors of this study are also authors of the new Harvard/CUNY study.) The Harvard/CUNY study arrived at the death figures by looking at the number of individuals with depression, the number of patients on diabetic medications, the number of women who had a mammogram or pap smear in the past year and the number of people who had catastrophic medical expenses in the past year. We interviewed two of the authors of the study, including Harvard professor Danny McCormick. The lack of Medicaid expansion will mean that patients nationwide won’t get certain diagnostic tests or take certain medications. ""Cumulatively, that amounts to vast numbers of deaths,"" McCormick said. We asked McCormick how researchers can know that the differences in the death rates between the Medicaid expansion states and the states that didn’t expand were as a result of Medicaid. ""We don’t know absolutely because we didn’t do a randomized control trial with long-term followup on millions of people,"" McCormick said. ""For $10 billion we could do that study."" Experts weigh in on study We asked a variety of health policy experts their opinion about Crist’s claim. Many experts told PolitiFact that denying Medicaid to poor Floridians will harm their health. But placing a precise figure as to how many will die per day, they added, is difficult. ""There is strong consensus in the public health community that this is a very harmful policy,"" said Harold Pollack, who told PolitiFact he is a ""liberal health policy wonk"" at the University of Chicago. However ""the most difficult aspect of that policy to investigate is its effect on mortality."" Pollack said Crist is on solid ground to point out that the lack of Medicaid expansion causes serious harm. However, ""I personally believe that these mortality estimates were on the high side of an inherently difficult calculation."" Pollack pointed to a 2009 study by Richard Kronick, then a University of California San Diego medical professor who later went to work for the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. His study concluded that the risk of mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance. Uninsured individuals can still get some health care, but they use fewer services than the insured, which increases their risk, said Jonathan Oberlander, who studies health care politics and policy at the University of North Carolina. ""There are different estimates in the literature of how much uninsurance increases mortality (and at least one significant study that doesn’t confirm that claim),"" Oberlander told PolitiFact. ""But in general I’d say that former Gov. Crist is on solid ground in saying that Florida's decision to not expand Medicaid could lead to more deaths from uninsured Floridians, which could have been reduced if the state expands Medicaid. However, getting an exact number is difficult. There are estimates, and the Health Affairs study is just one estimate."" Some of the criticisms we heard focused on shortcomings of the underlying studies. George Washington University professor Leighton Ku said that the Sommers/Baicker study looking at the mortality in a few states was ""relatively rigorous"" but warned that it came with caveats. The authors wrote acknowledged that it may not be possible to generalize its findings to other states. Also the study states that it ""cannot definitively show causality."" ""It makes sense to believe that giving low-income people Medicaid health insurance coverage will lead to improved health access and improved health and could eventually reduce mortality,"" Ku told PolitiFact in an email. ""But it is important to recognize that it might take a number of years before such an effect is realized."" Ku said that the new Medicaid death study ""is somewhat speculative, but plausible. It did not go through the more rigorous peer review that would normally be required to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. I think there is pretty good evidence that Medicaid saves lives, but how many and how long it takes is a little harder to say."" Other scholars are more critical of the study. Duke University professor Chris Conover, an adjunct scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the study of three states only found a statistically significant decrease in mortality in New York and that the New York benefits are more generous than most states. The study, he said, doesn’t prove that the reasons for the differences between mortality in New York (which expanded Medicaid) and Pennsylvania (which didn’t) result from differing approaches to expanding Medicaid. ""If people are willing to overlook the study’s clear methodological limitations to claim it ‘proves’ Medicaid saved lives in New York, then they have to be prepared to concede that Maine and Arizona’s Medicaid programs evidently had no impact on mortality,"" Conover wrote in his blog. Baicker, author of one of the underlying studies, said that the new study is ""a blog post (rather than a refereed article), so I really can't speak to the quality of methods they use."" ""The point of most studies like this is to take estimates of the effect of a particular program and forecast what would happen to a population overall based on those estimates,"" Baicker said. ""All such estimates come with uncertainty, and don't point to the specific individuals or, for example, specific times of death."" Our ruling Crist said that Florida’s decision not to expand Medicaid means that ""six people in Florida die as a result of that every day."" The statistic is based on a recent study, but experts note a few caveats. First, Crist used the study’s high-end figure; using the low-end figure cuts the number of deaths to three a day. Second, experts caution about uncertainties about the studies upon which the new study was based. And third, while many experts agree that it’s plausible to assume that the lack of Medicaid coverage could lead to deaths, they were careful to add that it is difficult to pinpoint a number as precise as the one Crist offered.

Hoping to replicate that success, Democrats this year are hammering Republicans on women’s health issues in the early stages of the 2014 midterm campaign season. A good example is Colorado, where Democratic Sen. Mark Udall is expected to face Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., in November. Udall recently released a 30-second ad attacking Gardner on abortion and birth control. ""Congressman Cory Gardner’s history promoting harsh anti-abortion laws is disturbing,"" the narrator says. ""Gardner sponsored a bill to make abortion a felony, including cases of rape and incest. Gardner even championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control here in Colorado."" Udall’s campaign said Gardner’s ""crusade to outlaw birth control"" stems from his support of efforts to add so-called ""personhood"" language that would define life beginning at fertilization to the Colorado Constitution. Opponents of personhood legislation say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of person could make illegal several FDA-approved contraceptives. (More on that in a bit.) Anti-abortion groups successfully petitioned to get personhood measures on the Colorado ballot in 2008 and 2010. Both times it was rejected by more than 70 percent of voters. In a further complication, Gardner recently made a major about-face, saying he no longer supports the personhood movement, partly because he now thinks it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. ""The fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position,"" Gardner told The Denver Post. ""I've learned to listen. I don't get everything right the first time."" Despite this, Gardner’s camp still contends Udall’s ad is misleading because Gardner thought he was supporting an anti-abortion measure, not a referendum on birth control. Gardner’s campaign argues that it’s an exaggeration of his position to claim that he’s ""championed"" a ""crusade to outlaw birth control."" What are we to make of this? We can’t predict how the courts would interpret personhood legislation or its impact on legal birth control. Though even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, a lot of legal ambiguity remains. Because no state has passed a personhood measure, we don’t know how it could impact specific types of contraceptives. As we’ve noted in past articles about the debate over personhood, some legal scholars and the medical community have cautioned that it could potentially impact access to birth control. In a 2011 op-ed to the New York Times, Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard University, and Jonathan Will, law professor at Mississippi College, said what is considered ""fertilization"" is not even clear. Fertilization could mean at least four different things: ""penetration of the egg by a sperm,"" successful combination of the genetic information from sperm and egg, activation of the genetic information, and ""implantation of the embryo in the uterus,"" Cohen and Will wrote. Sperm penetration occurs almost immediately, but implantation can take up to two weeks. ""Thus, on some reasonable readings of the amendment, certain forms of birth control ... would seem impermissible, while on other equally reasonable readings they are not."" Therefore, it is difficult to know how courts would react, especially considering that past rulings have affirmed the right of access to birth control. A personhood law could present proponents an opportunity to challenge those rulings. So we’re left trying to determine whether Gardner’s past positions in support of personhood could reasonably be considered as championing a crusade against birth control. Gardner’s history In 2006, Colorado Right to Life asked all politicians running for office if they supported the Right to Life Act in Congress, ""recognizing that personhood begins at fertilization."" Gardner, then a first-term state representative answered yes. Udall’s campaign provided a television news story from March 17, 2008, that appears to briefly show Gardner in a room with several Republican colleagues signing on to the petition to put personhood on the Colorado ballot (around the 1-minute mark). Gardner’s campaign did not respond to questions about his support of the 2008 referendum. His campaign did, however, acknowledge that Gardner supported the referendum efforts in 2010 at a candidate forum. In a video clip from the forum, Gardner says he signed the petition and circulated it at his church. He also said the measure ""backs up my support for life,"" but did not mention contraceptives or birth control. News stories from Colorado papers in 2008 and 2010 mention the debate over contraceptives involved in personhood legislation. In fact, Ken Buck, the 2010 Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Colorado, backed away from his previous support of the personhood referendum because he said it could impact some forms of birth control. So contraception was a live issue at the time. But Cohen, the Harvard professor, told PolitiFact that ""it is unclear that the Colorado 2008 and 2010 referendums were intended to ‘outlaw birth control in Colorado’ — that's what the word ‘crusade’ seems to imply. It is more clear that the language of those amendments might have outlawed some forms of birth control, whether that was the goal or not."" In other words, Gardner may have been in favor of the amendment, but for reasons other than curbing contraception. Since getting elected to Congress in 2010, Gardner has co-sponsored the Life Begins at Conception Act in 2012 and 2013, which has been described as federal personhood legislation. But he was hardly alone in doing so, nor was he an early backer. In 2012, he was one of the final cosponsors of 120 lawmakers, joining a full 14 months after the bill was introduced. In 2013, the bill had 128 sponsors, with Gardner signing on four months after introduction. Gardner’s campaign notes that in 2007, he was one of five to cosponsor an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specified that ""nothing in this section shall prohibit the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug or chemical."" This bill, his campaign said, demonstrates that while Gardner is pro-life, he is not anti-contraceptive. Udall’s campaign, though, noted Gardner also voted against the ""Birth Control Protection Act"" in 2009, a response to the 2008 personhood ballot referendum, which became law. Our ruling Udall’s ad said Gardner ""championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control here in Colorado."" It’s clear Gardner has supported personhood in the past, and it’s hard for him to claim ignorance about the measure’s threat to contraception, given the media attention that aspect of the law attracted at the time. Gardner also voted against a bill that would have legally protected birth control. Still, the effort is probably more accurately described as a crusade against abortion than against birth control, and ""championed"" is also a strong word to describe Gardner’s role, since it implies that he was a leader in the cause.

165,pomt-00657,"The 2005 round of military base closings ""has not yet resulted in savings.""",half-true,/virginia/statements/2015/may/15/rob-wittman/rob-wittman-says-2005-brac-round-base-closings-has/,"U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman is trying to thwart the Pentagon’s efforts to begin a new round of military base closing. There have been five rounds of closures in recent decades, starting in the late 1980s as the Soviet Union collapsed and the U.S. military retooled for a post-Cold War mission. The last round took place in 2005 and talk of new spate is worrying congressmen who have bases in their districts. Wittman, a Republican, represents Virginia’s 1st District which includes the Army’s Fort A.P. Hill and the Marine base in Quantico. He recently questioned whether a new round of the Base Realignment and Closure program -- known as BRAC -- made strategic and economic sense. ""We cannot forget that the 2005 BRAC round has not yet resulted in savings,"" he stated in an April 30 news release. We checked to see if he was right about the lacking of savings. Gordon Neal, Wittman’s spokesman, sent us a 2009 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office that examined the bottom line of the 2005 BRAC, which shuttered 24 bases, realigned 24 others and eliminated about 12,000 civilian jobs. Calculations in the report were based on a Pentagon estimate that the 2005 BRAC would save Uncle Sam $3.9 billion a year -- an estimate that the GAO said is probably high. The GAO also noted that the military spent $35 billion implementing BRAC, far above the original $21 billion estimate. For example, it cost $1.7 billion more than expected to close Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington and move its operations to Fort Belvoir, Va. and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. A chart in the report shows the annual savings started in 2006, but those economies weren’t expected to be enough to pay off the upfront costs of BRAC until 2018, five years later than originally projected. The GAO updated its analysis in 2012 and found that the savings and cost estimates were still about the same. That’s the last time the agency did a cost analysis of the 2005 BRAC. ""So 2018 should still be about the time that the savings would exceed the cost,"" Brian Lepore, GAO’s director of defense capabilities and management, wrote in an email. We spoke to two defense budget analysts and they both told us that Wittman’s statement is correct that the U.S. hasn’t yet pocketed ""net savings"" from the realignment. But that doesn’t mean the program isn’t paying off. Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the last round of BRAC is producing savings but, for the moment, they’re going towards recovering the costs of implementing the program. ""We are going to hit the break even point, and after that it’s all savings,"" Harrison told us. Harrison was among nearly 40 defense analysts who late last month signed a letter supporting the Pentagon’s call for another round of closings, saying there are surplus military installations around the nation. Harrison said Wittman’s use of the 2005 BRAC to argue against another round is off base. The last realignment round was different from the four that came in the 1980s and 1990s, Harrison said, because it focused much more heavily on base consolidations than previous rounds that were mostly directed at merely shuttering facilities. Consolidations are more expensive, he said, because they entail moving operations from one place to another, which means buildings have to be constructed. In 2012, Dorothy Robyn, then deputy under secretary of defense, made the same point in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee. ""In short, the 2005 round took place during a period of growth in the military, and it reflected the goals and needs of that time. Because the focus was on transforming installations to better support forces -- as opposed to saving money and space -- it is a poor gauge of the savings that the Department can achieve through another BRAC round,"" she stated in written testimony. Robyn said the previous BRAC rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995 totaled $8 billion in annual savings. Our ruling Wittman said that the 2005 BRAC round has ""not resulted in savings."" Savings are coming in every year, but they haven’t yet reached the break-even point of paying back the costs of BRAC. That’s expected to happen in 2018 and, after that, the money can be used for other purposes. Wittman’s statement is missing important information and creates a faulty impression that the 2005 BRAC has been a loser.

That’s what a largely plagiarized story on the website opreminfo.com claimed. But what he said was more nuanced. Facebook flagged this story as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So we decided to investigate. It turns out that a large part of the article is copied, word-for-word, from a 2017 Reuters article titled, ""Pope says migrants’ rights should override national security concerns."" The only differences between the two are that the opreminfo.com article omits the final two paragraphs of the Reuters story, and it also has a different headline singling out Muslim migrants. Reuters is a reputable source, and a 2017 Guardian article corroborates much of their story. But this recently posted article has a few problems. First, there's an issue of timing. The story begins with the statement, ""Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants."" The Reuters article began with those same words, but it was published in August 2017, and was referring to a message the pope put out that same month, ahead of the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees. In it, the pope reiterates an earlier address and says, ""Our shared response may be articulated by four verbs: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate."" He then goes on to describe the task of ""welcoming"" as follows: ""Once again, I want to emphasize the importance of offering migrants and refugees adequate and dignified initial accommodation … The principle of the centrality of the human person, firmly stated by my beloved predecessor, Benedict XVI, obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security … The situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees requires that they be guaranteed personal safety and access to basic services. For the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorization."" The opreminfo.com article, published July 10, 2018, refers to that message. However, it says the pope ""urged political leaders on Monday,"" even though the pope’s remarks were published nearly a year ago. Secondly, the Reuters article makes no reference to ""Muslim migrants."" Rather, it mentions that the pope called for ""broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally."" We didn’t find any reference to Muslim migrants in the pope’s message. Our ruling An article on Facebook claimed, ""Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country."" The pope discussed ensuring all migrants' ""personal safety over national security."" But this article cherry-picked a subgroup of migrants to make it seem like he was only talking about Muslims.

167,pomt-00659,"Proposed fast-track legislation allows presidents to ""easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/14/elizabeth-warren/fact-checking-elizabeth-warren-and-barack-obama-tr/,"President Barack Obama’s international trade agenda is moving forward in Congress, after facing temporary defeat by fellow Democrats in the Senate. Obama is butting heads with many Democrats over this issue, but his squabble with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been the most public. Most recently, Warren said if Obama gets his way on trade, it could unravel Dodd-Frank -- Obama’s hallmark financial regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis. ""In the next few weeks, Congress will decide whether to give the president fast-track authority,"" Warren said in May 5 remarks at the liberal Institute for New Economic Thinking. ""This is a long-term problem — a six-year problem. If fast-track passes, a Republican president could easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules."" Obama responded to that claim in a May 8 interview with Yahoo’s Matt Bai. ""She’s absolutely wrong,"" he said. ""Think about the logic of that, right? The notion that I had this massive fight with Wall Street to make sure that we don’t repeat what happened in 2007, 2008. And then I sign a provision that would unravel it? I’d have to be pretty stupid."" So who’s right here? We decided to dig into the substance of their arguments and see if Dodd-Frank really is in danger because of the trade debate. Buckle up. Alphabet soup A lot of media coverage has conflated two distinct aspects of the trade debate. The first is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is the trade deal that Obama is currently negotiating with several countries along the Pacific. The second is Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which is a piece of legislation that would allow trade agreements (such as the TPP) to move through Congress under special rules intended to speed up the process, thus its nickname ""fast-track."" Most trade deals since the 1970s have been accompanied by fast-track legislation. If the fast-track rules pass, Congress would not be able to amend or filibuster a trade agreement, which means the deal would only need 51 votes in the Senate to pass, as opposed to the 60 votes necessary without fast-track. And the rules would apply to all trade agreements before Congress for the next six years. Supporters say fast-track is necessary to bolster confidence among foreign partners that domestic politics won’t dismantle a trade agreement. Critics, like Warren, argue that this drastically diminishes Congress’ role in the process, to its detriment. It’s the fast-track bill that Warren said could allow future politicians to ""easily"" chip away at Dodd-Frank or any other law. This is possible in theory. Here’s how. Imagine that the next president does not support Dodd-Frank regulations. He or she could -- unlike the Obama administration -- be open to discussing Dodd-Frank as part of foreign trade negotiations. The president could bring to Congress a trade agreement that requires scaling back Dodd-Frank to comply with the agreement parameters. (Congress doesn’t vote on the agreement itself, it votes on a bill that lays out how the agreement will be implemented under U.S. law.) The administration could try to push this through without fast-track, but it would likely face opposition from members of Congress like Warren, who could try to amend or filibuster the agreement in order to maintain Dodd-Frank as is. With fast-track, the agreement wouldn’t face these hurdles. Congress’ only option would be to vote against the whole agreement -- all or nothing. If enough Dodd-Frank supporters were to decide that the trade deal is more important, the agreement could pass, watered-down regulations and all. So Warren’s prediction is possible -- not ""absolutely wrong,"" as Obama said. However, as Obama also said, ""this is pure speculation."" How big of a risk exists is a much harder question to answer. Is it easy? Those who share Warren’s position argue that under fast-track, a trade deal only needs 51 Senate votes, as opposed to 60 without fast-track, and that makes a huge difference in how easy it is to move the deal through Congress. It could be a ""backdoor means of undermining Wall Street reform,"" said Ben Beachy, global trade research director at Public Citizen, an advocacy group that sides with Warren on this issue. Beachy noted that the Trans-Pacific Partnership might hurt Dodd-Frank, because it includes certain financial parameters that mirror many of the North American Free Trade Agreement’s ""pre-crisis, deregulatory rules that threaten financial regulations"" and would expand them further. However, what’s actually in the Trans-Pacific Partnership remains secret, and the White House denies this claim. Even accounting for the Senate vote threshold, though, nearly every expert we interviewed said Warren exaggerated the threat that fast-track authority would ""easily"" allow a Republican president to dissolve Dodd-Frank. ""The risks are very small, so in that sense I agree with Obama,"" said Bill Krist, senior policy scholar at the Wilson Center and a former trade official in the early 1980s. ""But in the more literal sense of Elizabeth Warren being ‘absolutely wrong,’ I don’t."" First of all, the fast-track bill currently on the table gives members of Congress other ways to object to the negotiations, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a trade official at the Treasury in the late 1970s. It allows a bipartisan group of Congress to advise and serve as delegates. Relatedly, the fast-track bill gives Congress the ability to reject fast-track for a particular trade deal if it fails to meet certain congressional objectives. Additionally, trade negotiations take a long time, so it’s hard to envision a new president coming in, reversing the U.S. position on financial regulation, and finalizing a deal by 2021 (the end of the fast-track bill’s time frame). For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, nearing completion this year, has been in the works since 2005. ""The proposition that suddenly a trade deal is going to appear and it’s inconsistent with Dodd-Frank is not going to work,"" said Brookings Institution fellow and international trade expert Joshua Metzler, adding that the parameters of a trade deal ""are seen from miles away."" It’s also important to keep in mind that future administrations could go after Dodd-Frank through the courts, by passing domestic legislation, or through regulatory discretion -- all of which would be more much more efficient than going through international negotiations, Hufbauer said. ""It’s always possible that a future administration will do things in the financial area that she doesn’t like,"" he said. Warren argues changing regulation through trade agreements is ""hardly a hypothetical possibility"" -- there’s evidence of big banks on both sides of the Atlantic trying to push through Dodd-Frank reductions through a trade deal with the European Union currently in progress. U.S. officials, such as Trade Representative Mike Froman and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, have acknowledged the pressure coming from banks to consider changing financial regulations as part of the negotiating process. They have, however, staunchly avoided such discussions. Of course, as Warren said in her May 5 remarks, this attitude might not carry into the next administration. But even if a new administration thinks trade negotiations are the appropriate avenue for dismissing financial regulations, it might not be so simple to get all parties to agree. Some regulations in Europe in particular -- such as those affecting credit rating agencies, insurance companies and banker bonuses -- ""are more stringent than those adopted by the United States in the financial crisis,"" said Chris Brummer, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and Georgetown University law professor. One final issue We wanted to briefly address the issue of investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS), a form of international arbitrage in which an investor can bring a claim against a foreign government. It’s not 100 percent germane to the topic at hand, but it’s been getting mixed up in the discussions about the Obama-Warren trade dispute. As it stands, the Trans-Pacific Partnership will have this type of settlement system. Warren and others oppose the settlements for a number of reasons: the proceedings are secretive, and the court can impose a fine on the foreign government so large that it changes its domestic laws as a result. The classic example of an ISDS case is tobacco giant Philip-Morris suing nations over their domestic anti-smoking laws, claiming the laws damage their profits. But Warren’s staff told us that her beliefs about ISDS are separate from her position on fast-track -- she didn’t mention ISDS in her May 5 remarks, when she said the fast-track bill could derail Dodd-Frank, nor when she made the same point on PBS Newshour May 13. (She has mentioned it in the past.) Obama appears to have misinterpreted Warren’s most recent comments. In responding to them in the Yahoo interview, he said her argument ""is based on this dispute-settlement provision I just talked about. There’s no evidence that this could ever be used in this way."" That’s basically true, said Brummer, of Georgetown Law. ""Virtually all trade agreements include regulatory carve-outs that limit the jurisdiction of the courts as relating to market supervision,"" he said, so it's highly unlikely that the Trans-Pacific Partnership or a deal with the European Union would cede authority to special arbitrators to unwind hard-fought financial reforms. ""At most, one would see a process elaborated for enhanced cross-border regulatory cooperation, something you already see in some accords."" In any case, in the statement we are fact-checking, Warren was not arguing that ISDS would be cause for Dodd-Frank rollbacks, something we wanted to clarify. Our ruling Warren said proposed fast-track legislation would allow presidents to ""easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules."" It’s not entirely far-fetched that a trade deal could impact domestic financial rules -- in fact banks and some countries are pushing to make financial regulation part of ongoing negotiations with the European Union. And fast-track legislation would remove some congressional hurdles. However, that doesn’t mean the process would be easy. Negotiations take many years, and there are other obstacles that could stop watered-down financial regulations from making it into a final deal. Additionally, it is pure speculation that this fast-track bill in particular would result in scaled-back Dodd-Frank rules.

168,pomt-08370,"""More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/25/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-more-private-sector-jobs-created/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- who is in danger of losing her leadership position if the Republicans take over the House -- must really like the following talking point, because she's used it at least twice on national television in recent days. ""More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration,"" she said in an interview on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann on Oct. 21, 2010. The day before, Pelosi said something virtually identical in an interview on PBS' Charlie Rose Show. We thought we'd check to see if she's correct. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that tracks employment numbers. According to the BLS website, there were 111,634,000 Americans employed in the private sector at the start of George W. Bush's first term, in January 2001. Eight years later, in January 2009, there were 110,961,000 Americans employed in the private sector. So the United States lost 673,000 private-sector jobs on Bush's watch. That makes it easy for Pelosi: If the United States netted even one private-sector job in 2010, she'd be accurate. And the nation actually did quite a bit better than that. Private-sector employment in January 2010 was 107,123,000, a number that grew to 107,970,000 by Septmeber 2010. That works out to be 847,000 jobs created. So Pelosi's statement is accurate. But it's also a classic case of cherry-picking -- for two reasons. First, Pelosi carefully cited private-sector employment, not total employment. There's a valid reason to focus on private-sector jobs rather than government jobs, since private-sector jobs produce income-boosting goods and services to a degree that government jobs do not. Still, choosing private-sector jobs helps Pelosi's case in a crucial way: If she'd chosen total employment instead, her formulation would have been wrong. Total employment -- that is, the combination of private- and public-sector jobs -- during Bush's tenure increased by 1.08 million, while total employment in 2010 has increased by 599,000. (Quick aside: Who would have thought that federal and state government jobs would have increased by 1.7 million in eight years under Bush and fallen by 357,000 since President Barack Obama took office?) Second, Pelosi chose her start and end dates in a way that's highly favorable to Obama and unfavorable to Bush. If she'd instead chosen to start from the beginning of Obama's term -- rather than half way through his first two years -- she would be stuck with a net loss of nearly 3 million private-sector jobs, not the increase of 847,000 she came up with for 2010. Pelosi essentially started counting from the low point for jobs and only counted the upward part of the trendline. Meanwhile, the start and end points she used for Bush give the former president no such break. The jobs picture under Bush looked like an arc, heading generally upward through mid 2007 before heading downward again. If she had used only the upward portion of the arc, as she did for Obama, it would have showed a gain of 3.9 million private-sector jobs. You could argue that it's unfair to pin the blame on Obama for job losses early in his tenure. Still, Pelosi drew the lines for her comparison as artfully as state legislatures have been known to draw lines defining congressional districts, and, similarly, Pelosi's choices are not just highly selective but also beneficial to her side. To be fair, Pelosi's staff points out that they have not shied from showing the full arc of the jobs numbers since Obama took office, attaching a fact sheet showing both the decline and rise in jobs since Obama's inauguration. But her televised comments don't reflect that. To fully understand the jobs comparison Pelosi makes, you need to understand how she sliced and diced the numbers. It's a good example of a statement that is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. -- the Truth-O-Meter's definition of Half True.

An e-mail newsletter sent by a membership group of state foster homes and other child services said that by 12th grade, ""more than 3 out of 10 girls have been pregnant at least once."" Really? That much? Normer Adams, executive director of the Georgia Association of Homes and Services for Children, is editor of Welfare Watch. The newsletter used the teen pregnancy statistic to illustrate the need for programs and praise the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention's (G-CAPP) Second Chance Homes, where teen mothers live as they learn to be self-sufficient. Here's what the newsletter said: ""By the 12th grade, 63% of all students have had sex and more than 3 out of 10 girls have been pregnant at least once."" This item deals with the pregnancy statistic. Adams said he got his information from the Web site of G-CAPP, which is a major statewide nonprofit that advocates to lower teen pregnancy rates. G-CAPP's ""Fast Facts"" page gives a list of statistics on the state of teen pregnancy in Georgia and nationally. ""Three in ten girls in the U.S. become pregnant at least once before age 20,"" it states. That's not by twelfth grade, but by age 20. So the newsletter didn't accurately cite the figure. Still, ""three in ten"" in the U.S. seemed like a lot, so we called the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit that produces statistics and other information frequently used by teen pregnancy prevention groups. It's where G-CAPP got its figures. The group calculated the pregnancy statistic itself, said Bill Albert, its chief program officer. An April 2008 fact sheet on the statistic said it was based on 2004 teen pregnancy rates from the National Center for Health Statistics, the most recent figures at the time. The usual teen pregnancy rate measures the rate of teen pregnancy in a single year. The figure from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy is different because it measures the ""cumulative risk of teen pregnancy over a teen girl's entire life up to age 20,"" according to its fact sheet. The group totaled the teen pregnancy rate for girls in each of those 10 years, adjusting for teens who have multiple pregnancies. It found that 29.81 percent of girls become pregnant at least once as a teen, or three in 10. To get an independent take on the subject, we contacted the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that performs social science research, policy analysis and public education on sexual and reproductive health in the U.S. and internationally. It checked data from the National Survey of Family Growth that was released last month. The survey, a sample of 15- to 44-year-olds across the nation, was conducted between 2006 and 2008 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just under 28 percent of women who were age 20 at the time of the survey reported having ever been pregnant, according to the data. That's very close to 29.81 percent from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Or three in 10. And for girls who are 18, the typical age for a 12th-grader, that figure was about 17 percent, according to that same set of data. So why don't we notice more of these pregnant teens? Albert from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said only about half of these teens give birth. ""Some may have hidden the pregnancies, some may have elected to terminate the pregnancy, others may have suffered a fetal loss,"" Albert said. ""In short, pregnancy is -- up to a point -- hard to detect. Children are not."" So yes, three in 10 females in the U.S. become pregnant at least once by age 20. This means that while Welfare Watch got the statistic from the G-CAPP Web site wrong, it's correct that a significant percentage of U.S. teens become pregnant. So while the statement is generally true, it was off-target on some important information.

170,pomt-06115,"Says constitutional amendment would ""help to stop unfair, double taxation on real estate.""",half-true,/oregon/statements/2011/dec/30/Yes-on-79/are-oregon-home-sellers-really-subject-double-tax/,"While we were trolling for some new facts to check, a rather urgent ad popped out at us on one of our favorite conservative websites: ""Sign the Petition. Stop Unfair, Double Taxes,"" it read. The text was superimposed on a picture of a home with a ""For Sale"" sign. We were curious, so we clicked through. We landed on a website for Protect Oregon Homes. There, the same pitch continued in earnest. We were greeted with a picture of a home for sale. ""Sold -- with double tax!"" read the sign out front. On the side of the page was a calculator that helps visitors compute their property transfer tax. It was preset at just under 2 percent of the sales price. ""Sign the Petition! We need your help to stop unfair, double taxation on real estate,"" is the first bit of text on the site, referring to a push for a constitutional ban on real estate transfer taxes. Wow, we thought. Do we really have a double tax on real estate? We decided to check. The taxation that the site is looking to ""stop"" would kick into effect when a home swaps hands. Protect Oregon Homes, backed by the Oregon Association of Realtors, is looking to amend the state constitution to bar ""state/local governments from imposing taxes, fees, assessments on transfer of any interest in real property."" There’s just one problem. When we looked a little further, we found out that there is only one such tax in the entire state (Washington County imposes a 0.1 percent transfer tax) and this proposed legislation would grandfather that charge in, just as previous legislation did. What’s more, beside that one-time Washington County exception, under current law, cities, counties and other jurisdictions don’t have the power to impose taxes on real estate transfers. So what gives? What would an amendment be stopping? Shaun Jillions, a spokesperson for Oregon Association of Realtors, explains it this way: ""There's nothing in that (current) statute that stops the state Legislature from"" instituting one or repealing the current ban. His line was pretty close to the one featured on the group’s website: The ""state Legislature has the authority, subject to governor approval, to impose such taxes and fees or to change current statutory law,"" the site says. ""Local officials would welcome any source of new revenue to keep their operations going. A new revenue stream from a tax on property sales would be very tempting ... We need a law to take this law off the table. Forever."" Essentially, this is all about a strong defense being the best offense. The website even says so: ""During the past five legislative sessions, there have been nine attempts to authorize such a tax at the state or local level."" Jillions mentioned that same fact and even followed up a with a list of of the bills Realtors had been tracking. A single bill was introduced in the 2011 session but died without a hearing. The same happened to three bills during the 2009 session. In 2007, a bill that would open up the doors to transfer taxes did get multiple hearings, but it failed, too. Two bills in 2005 died without hearings and in 2003 two bills were introduced, only one got a single hearing, and both ultimately died. We asked Jillions about the poor showing most of these bills made. Did it seem a little disingenuous to say that there’s a double tax when there’s a law banning such charges and the bills put forward to end that ban have been largely dead on arrival? ""That might have something to do with the lobbying efforts of the Oregon Association of Realtors,"" he said. We went one step further to gauge the Legislature’s interest in repealing the current ban and talked to Sen. Ginny Burdick, one of the chairs of the Revenue Committee. ""I've not heard any push to do this in February, "" she said, referring to the next time the Legislature meets. ""It's certainly not on my priority list. ""I don't see this coming up in the near future, but with the budget problems we have any revenue source can and should be on the table."" Jillions also pointed to the fact that Multnomah County Commissioner Deborah Kafoury has been bullish about such a tax. Indeed, she sponsored a bill to overturn the ban back in 2003 when she was a state lawmaker. Most recently, she told Willamette Week that ""putting a pre-emption into the constitution is really tying the hands of local voters. It’s already state law, and I don’t see why that’s not good enough."" Finally, Jillions told us to take a look at a report issued in June 2008 by the governor’s Task Force on Federal Forest Payments and County Services. In the report, there’s a suggestion that the state drop its pre-emption of real estate transfer taxes. But that was issued years ago and we’re no closer to passing legislation of that nature now than we were then. Even with the report, the noncommittal statements from Burdick and a possible interest from one county commissioner, it doesn’t seem like a transfer tax is imminent, let alone even in existence. The Protect Oregon Homes website says signing the petition will ""help to stop unfair, double taxation on real estate"" when, in fact, there is only one such tax in Oregon and the repeal they’re floating would do nothing to end it. What’s more, a repeal of the current pre-emption, while certainly possible, is not something that the Legislature appears to be actively considering. Protect Oregon Homes acknowledges some of these points on their website, which tempers our ruling somewhat, but the general feeling you get from the group is that there’s a tax on the books -- or there will be soon -- and only a constitutional amendment will stop it. In fact, there is no double tax to stop.

171,pomt-00072,"""Mark Harris has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare.""",half-true,/north-carolina/statements/2018/nov/01/dan-mccready/mccready-half-right-about-harris-wanting-cut-entit/,"Seniors are among the most consistent election participants in part because they’re reliant on the largest U.S. safety net programs. So it would be politically risky for a candidate to declare his desire to cut Medicare and Social Security. And yet, Democrat Dan McCready recently accused Republican Mark Harris of admitting just that. Harris and McCready are running for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, which stretches from Charlotte to south-central North Carolina. It’s currently held by Robert Pittenger, who Harris beat in the Republican primary. There are 116,000 people in the 9th district over 65 (the age at which most people become eligible for Medicare and full Social Security benefits) and about 100,000 more who stand to collect Social Security benefits within the next 15 years, NC political expert Michael Bitzer recently told the Charlotte Observer. In a debate on Oct. 10, things got heated between Harris and McCready after a moderator asked about how they’d continue to pay for Social Security. ""Mark Harris has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare,"" McCready said. The full debate is available on the Charlotte Observer website, and McCready made this claim around the 12-minute mark of the video. Harris said he was offended by McCready’s accusation. ""I have never said that. That is a lie that’s being perpetrated throughout the campaign and throughout the district,"" Harris said. ""I have always said we’ve got to keep Social Security solvent, we’ve got to make sure that it’s a promise made and a promise kept. And we will continue to do that."" Harris then accused McCready of wanting to raise taxes to support those programs. He continued: ""I do think we need to look at a graduated system that keeps the promise we’ve made to those that are retired and are heading toward retirement. I think when you get further back in the younger years, we need to have a graduated program that may involve options."" McCready’s argument McCready then presented a three-pronged argument for how Harris has indicated intentions to cut Medicare and Social Security. ""You supported a $1.9 trillion tax bill that takes $25 billion out of Medicare,"" McCready said to Harris. ""You’ve said you would join the Freedom Caucus, whose stated purpose is to reform Social Security as we know it,"" McCready said. ""And you said in 2014 at the Lake Norman debate that younger people would be the big loser under your plan."" Harris responded by saying, ""I’ve never expressed an overall plan except to make the point that younger people today who do not see Social Security being there when they reach it need to have some kind of options in place."" Contacted by PolitiFact, McCready’s campaign emailed video of a 2014 U.S. Senate primary debate Harris participated in, a link to an online voter guide Harris filled out for this year’s primary and two news stories — by the Washington Post and Reuters — about how Republicans want to cut entitlement programs to compensate for revenue losses from the recent tax cut. The tax cuts and Freedom Caucus The Republican tax cuts are projected to shorten the life expectancy of the programs, as PolitiFact has previously reported. The tax law trimmed a year of solvency from the primary Medicare trust fund and had a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund, PolitiFact reported in a fact check of President Donald Trump. But it’s unfair for McCready to say that, because Harris supports the tax cuts, he by extension supports further cuts to Medicare. PolitiFact couldn’t find evidence that Harris has explicitly said he wants to cut Medicare, and McCready’s camp didn’t provide any. As for the Freedom Caucus, Harris has said he’d join the conservative group. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus leader, says on his website that ""Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be at the center of any serious proposal to return spending to sustainable levels."" However, Meadows adds, ""I do not support seriously proposing radical changes to current or soon-to-be retirees’ benefits. But if we are to continue providing these safety-nets for Americans in need we must renegotiate expectations with younger Americans. This could include increasing the retirement age for those just starting their careers, raising or eliminating the cap on payroll taxes for higher wage earners and creating incentives for personal retirement and health care savings."" What has Harris said? Now let’s look at the 2014 debate and the voter guide. In the video of the debate, Harris sounds a lot like Meadows. Harris says everyone currently over 50 should be guaranteed that they will get Social Security when they retire, but younger people shouldn’t receive that same guarantee. ""There may be a way that we’re able to scale back for others that are under 50. I’ll soon be 48, and … my generation may very well be the big loser in Social Security, but we may be able to say that at least I took care of my parents and my grandparents with what I paid into it."" He continued: ""I would rather, quite frankly, have you make the adjustment on me as a man about to turn 48, and free my children – age 25, 24, and 22 up – instead of continuing to tax them and put money into a system that they will never, ever see a dime out of it. So we’ve got to come up with a solution that will hit those generations and it’s got to be thoughtful and it’s got to be productive, but it is something that we can, we can work on and fix."" Harris’ response to iVoterGuide.com — completed for the Republican primary in this race — is similar. Harris wrote that Social Security is ""in a death spiral"" and ""needs to be overhauled."" ""However, we must honor our promises to existing retirees and those nearing retirement age keeping the current system in place for those folks,"" Harris wrote in the guide. ""In order to sustain a system that resembles Social Security, the system will need to operate in a balanced manner meaning that individuals only receive what they pay in, supplemented if desired by a government budget that should be based not on the whims of political gain but economic sensibility."" Our ruling McCready claimed Harris ""has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare."" PolitiFact couldn’t find an example of Harris describing a plan for changing Social Security and Medicare benefits for the people who get them now or stand to get them soon. On Medicare, McCready has failed to prove that Harris said he wants to cut the program at all. But on Social Security, it’s clear from his past and recent statements that his hopes for reform include changes that would limit future government payouts. Harris has used the word ""overhaul"" and said he’s open to scaling back Social Security for people under 50. However, he’s consistently said his desired reforms wouldn’t affect people who are in the program or stand to benefit from it in the next decade or so. We rate this claim Half True.

172,pomt-06609,"Says the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world with 2.3 million inmates, and the majority of Americans are imprisoned because they sold small amounts of drugs.",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/22/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-us-prisons-are-packed-small-time/,"Presidential candidate Gary Johnson, a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana, says U.S. prisons are packed with too many small-time drug dealers. In a meeting with the editorial board of The Telegraph in Nashua, N.H., the former New Mexico governor explained some of the reasoning for his controversial position: ""We now have 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, we have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world,"" Johnson said. ""The majority of those people behind bars are there because they sold small amounts of drugs."" We'll examine his claim in two parts: Is the U.S. really a global leader in incarcerating citizens? And are small amounts of drugs such as marijuana really to blame? Johnson’s New Hampshire Communications Director Matt Simon pointed us to some sources behind Johnson’s claim, citing data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and World Prison Brief, a publication of the International Centre for Prison Studies at the King's College School of Law in London. We checked the Bureau of Justice Statistics figures and confirmed there were 2.3 million prisoners in local jails and state and federal prisons at the end of 2009. The World Prison Brief lists prison population rates per 100,000 residents of each country. The U.S. tops the list with 743 prisoners per 100,000 residents, followed by Rwanda with 595, the Russian Federation with 559, Georgia with 547 and the Virgin Islands (USA) with 539. So Johnson is right with the first part of his claim about the total and the top ranking. But do small-time drug dealers make up the majority of U.S. prisoners? It depends whether you consider local, state or federal inmates, according to Tracy Snell, a statistician with the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The Bureau of Justice Statistics only investigates information regarding offense types every 5-7 years through inmate surveys, Snell said. So we had to go back to 2002 and 2004 for the most recent data that included the three levels of incarceration to determine what percentage of inmates were held for selling drugs. The data reveal: * Local level: 12.1 percent, which is far short of a majority. * State level: 14.6 percent, also far short of a majority. * Federal level: 50 percent. Because the overwhelming majority of all prisoners are held at the state and local level, the number imprisoned for drug offenses is significantly short of a majority. Also, those numbers include all drug sales under the category drug trafficking. The percentages would likely be even smaller if they were limited to sales of small amounts of drugs the way Johnson suggested. In our correspondence with Johnson’s campaign, Communications Director Simon admitted the error. ""After communicating with a few experts, I can now confirm that the third claim is inaccurate,"" Simon said. ""I believe the real number of those incarcerated for all drug-related crimes is closer to 25 percent of the overall population of incarcerated persons. ""Johnson may have been thinking specifically of the federal inmate population when he made the statement, and although there's difficulty in defining ‘small amounts,’ the statement is closer to being true if applied to inmates in federal prisons."" Gov. Johnson also admitted his need to clarify, Simon said. ""I just spoke with Gov. Johnson about his error and he said, ’I stand corrected, thanks!’ so I'm sure he won't repeat this claim,"" Simon said. So Johnson was correct to say that the U.S. has highest incarceration rate in the world, with an estimated total of 2.3 million inmates,but he was wrong that the majority of those imprisoned are being held for selling small amounts of drugs.

173,pomt-06068,"As a result of welfare reform, ""poverty levels went down to the lowest level ever for ... African-American children.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/09/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-welfare-reform-deserves-credit-/,"Fresh off his near-win in Iowa, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum held a town hall meeting in Brentwood, N.H., with voters on Jan. 4, 2011. He covered many topics, including one of his favorites: welfare reform. Santorum, who actively pushed for welfare changes as a member of Congress, talked about the effects of the 1996 reform law, telling the audience, ""Guess what happened? Poverty levels went down to the lowest level ever for ... one of the areas that had the highest level of poverty historically, which is African-American children."" We looked into the statement and found that Santorum is right that poverty rates declined after the reform’s passage. But opinions differ on the primary cause. What the reform did Santorum was first elected to the House in 1991 and helped write the Republicans’ Contract with America, which proposed a major overhaul to the federal welfare system. President Bill Clinton had been elected promising to ""end welfare as we know it."" The legislative battle over just how to do that spanned several years. In 1996, Santorum had moved on to the Senate, helping win passage of a law that transformed welfare from an entitlement -- guaranteeing cash for needy people -- to a temporary assistance program with dollar caps and time limits on what beneficiaries could receive. It shifted most of the administrative work to the states and required recipients to move toward work and financial independence. The idea was that people on welfare -- who were still poor because benefits did not exceed the poverty line -- would be motivated to seek job training and full employment and end up being better off financially. For backup to his claim about the reform’s positive effect on black child poverty, Santorum’s campaign pointed us to a 2006 report by the conservative Heritage Foundation. It argued that poverty rates declined following reform and have stayed low even through fluctuations in the economy. The report’s author, Robert Rector, testified before the House Ways and Means Committee that ""in the quarter century prior to welfare reform, the old welfare system failed to reduce poverty among black children. Since welfare reform, the poverty rate among black children has fallen at an unprecedented rate from 41.5 percent in 1995 to 32.9 percent in 2004."" We found this U.S. Census chart, which presents slightly different figures for poverty among African-Americans under age 18: 41.5 percent in 1995 but 33.4 in 2004. The general trend, however, is the same. Rector’s report includes a chart showing that even previous periods of economic expansion did not lead to a significant drop in welfare cases. ""How was the economic expansion of the 1990s different from the eight prior expansions?"" the report asks. ""The answer is welfare reform."" In an interview, Rector said those patterns have held true even through the current recession. ""There was a sort of structural shift downward around the period of welfare reform,"" he said. ""It really has remained at a substantially lower level, although recessions have an effect."" Other perspectives While Rector maintains that the economy played only a secondary role in reducing poverty, other groups says it’s the main driver. After all, welfare reform became law during the longest period of economic growth in U.S. history. ""While there was a decrease in poverty overall in the economic boom of the late 1990s, it was not a result of welfare reform but due to the strength of the broader economy,"" said Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""There was an increase in labor market participation by single mothers during these years, but much of that increase was lost when the economy weakened."" And Austin Nichols wrote in a 2006 report for the Urban Institute that improvements in the low-wage job market, especially for less-educated workers, benefited black children more than others because their parents tend to have less education. ""We still have welfare reform, but as the low-wage job market weakened, child poverty shot back up,"" Nichols said in an e-mail. The Census put the child poverty rate for African-Americans at 35.3 percent in 2009. Rector said it’s about 38 percent today. And a 2011 study by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a private charitable organization that describes its goal as ""helping build better futures for disadvantaged children in the United States,"" said that the last decade has been especially damaging for poor children. ""The official child poverty rate, which is a conservative measure of economic hardship, increased 18 percent between 2000 and 2009, essentially returning to the same level as the early 1990s,"" the report stated. Our ruling Santorum credited welfare reform for driving poverty down to the lowest level ever for African-American children. He’s right that the poverty rate did reach historic lows following the reform’s passage, but the reason why is not so clear cut. There’s good evidence that the policy changes took more people off the welfare rolls by requiring them to work. And working, it follows, makes people better off than reliance on relatively low levels of public assistance. But the booming economy of the late 1990s had a lot to do with former welfare recipients gaining employment, as there were ample jobs to be had. Experts say the law and the healthy employment picture combined to help lift people out of poverty. And recently, as the economy has weakened and unemployment increased, poverty rates have risen, too.

174,pomt-03386,"""We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail.""",half-true,/florida/statements/2013/jul/08/tony-perkins/wedding-vendors-have-been-forced-participate-same-/,"Let’s step away for a moment from the political implications of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage and fast-forward straight to the wedding day: What does it mean for those who make the white-tiered frosted wedding cake, arrange the bouquet tossed by the bride, or snap the ""I Do"" pics? Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, said on CBS’ Face the Nation a few days after the ruling that such wedding vendors have already been ""forced"" to serve same-sex couples. ""We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail. I can't think of anything that's more un-American than that. ... "" Host Bob Schieffer responded: ""How is it that bakers and florists are being forced to participate in this? I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here."" Perkins replied: ""Well, we're seeing in Washington state, Colorado, and some of the other states that have these anti-discrimination statutes that are being imposed, that when a same-sex couple comes and says, ‘I want you to take pictures of my wedding,’ or ‘I want you to bake a cake.’ And they say, ‘Look, my religious convictions will not allow me participate in that,’ they're literally being sued by the government, not the individuals, and they've even been adjudicated in such places as New Mexico. So we're going to see a loss of religious freedom. There is no question about it. It's already happening."" Have there been bakers who have laid down their wire whisks and refused to bake a cake for a gay couple and hauled off to jail? A florist nervously piecing together a floral arrangement under the threat of a cop? We decided to investigate. State anti-discrimination laws used in some legal challenges In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the Defense of Marriage Act that bars federal benefits for married same-sex couples, and it dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California’s law that banned gay marriage. The Prop 8 ruling means that same-sex couples in California can now get married again, but neither ruling makes gay marriage legal in every state -- currently 12 states allow gay marriages. While same-sex marriage laws can include exemptions for religious clergy who don’t want to officiate such unions, there aren’t typically exemptions for wedding vendors. So it’s possible for gay couples to take legal action against wedding vendors who refused to serve them if there are state or local anti-discrimination laws in place that include sexual orientation. About 21 states have such, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for gay rights. (Florida isn’t one of them, although some counties or cities have such laws.) ""These nondiscrimination laws say you cannot refuse to serve a couple because of sexual orientation,"" said Sarah Warbelow, an attorney and state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign. ""If you are a photographer and a same-sex couple comes to you and says we want to employ you, the photographer for whatever event -- whether it's a marriage ceremony, commitment ceremony or whether it’s a birthday party -- the laws of those states state you cannot refuse them on basis of sexual orientation."" Each state can have their own process and penalties -- the ones we reviewed are generally heard before a civil rights or human rights commission. It’s theoretically possible a vendor who lost such a lawsuit could face jail if they refused to comply with the order, but Warbelow said, ""I’ve never heard of anyone actually going to jail."" Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado The Family Research Council directed us to multiple cases, including one particular case that they argue includes the threat of jail: Masterpiece Cakeshop. In 2012, a gay couple visited the suburban Denver shop in search of a cake for a Colorado celebration following their Massachusetts wedding. After the cake shop refused, the ACLU initiated a complaint on behalf of the two men. The Colorado attorney general’s office later filed a formal complaint which will be heard before the state’s civil rights commission in September. The owner has said, ""We would close down the bakery before we would compromise our beliefs."" The cake shop’s lawyer, Nicolle Martin, has said if the owner loses he could face up to a year in jail. In the meantime, though, the Colorado Legislature has taken action to repeal the criminal penalties for discrimination in places of public accommodations, which had included up to a year in jail and/or a $300 fine. The provision had never been used, and the repeal coincided with legislators passing a civil unions bill. We reached bill co-sponsor state Sen. Pat Steadman, D-Denver, who told us that the repeal officially goes into effect in August, and he didn’t believe that a prosecutor would use that part of the law in the last month that it remains on the books. ""A D.A. has to choose to file misdemeanor charges,"" Steadman said. ""It never happened. It never will."" However, since the Masterpiece Cakeshop incident occurred in 2012, Martin said it’s still possible that the law on the books at the time -- which did include jail -- would apply. ""I have received no assurances from the state of Colorado that no prosecution will be pursued even in light of this recent repeal,"" Martin told PolitiFact. We checked with both the Colorado attorney general and the local district attorney; no criminal charges are pending. Even if no one has been jailed so far, the threat remains, said Ken Klukowski, a senior fellow for religious liberty at the FRC. ""It is no comfort to a person of faith to cite the frequency a person is criminally prosecuted and put behind bars especially in a rapidly changing legal environment ...,"" he said. ""The threat of prosecution has a chilling effect on people's behavior."" Completed cases in Vermont and New Jersey Of the other cases related to wedding vendors cited by Perkins, only a couple have reached a conclusion. The Wildflower Inn in Vermont told a lesbian couple in 2010 that the inn didn't host ""gay receptions"" because of the owners' ""personal feelings."" After a lawsuit, it agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, to place $20,000 in a charitable trust and to stop hosting weddings -- whether the couple is gay or straight. The director of the Vermont Human Rights Commission told PolitiFact that the inn has paid the first half of the fine and the second half is due in September. The owners didn’t face jail based on the complaint itself. However, under Vermont law, failure to pay a fine can lead to a civil contempt action. ""This is no different than any other defendant who has a judgment against him/her and refuses to pay,"" director Karen Richards told PolitiFact in an email. ""As a practical matter, most unpaid judgments do not result in contempt proceedings, nor do they result in incarceration, except in very extreme cases, such as child support cases, where the party clearly has the money and is basically thumbing its nose at the court. I am not aware of any case in Vermont that resulted in a jail time for a defendant in any type of discrimination case."" In New Jersey, the Methodist Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association refused to allow a lesbian couple to hold a ceremony at its boardwalk pavilion in 2007. The New Jersey Division on Civil Rights ruled in 2012 that the association, which gets a tax exemption, must cease and desist violating the law but did not impose a fine or other penalty. The association stopped renting out the pavilion for marriages, an attorney who represented the association during the legal battle told PolitiFact. New Jersey can impose a fine of up to $10,000 for a first offense. A provision of the law states that anyone violating an order as a result of a legal challenge could face up to a year in jail or a fine. ""However, no attorney I've spoken with here is aware of this provision ever having been used to prosecute anyone, and there are no reported cases of it,"" Lee Moore, a spokesman for the state's Department of Law and Public Safety, told PolitiFact. Pending cases One case we reviewed received considerable publicity but ultimately went nowhere. In Oregon, a TV news station reported that Sweet Cakes by Melissa co-owner Aaron Klein allegedly told a lesbian couple that ""they were abominations to the Lord"" and refused to fill the order. Klein told the media he didn’t use that phrase, and that after the publicity he received death threats and his wedding business fell by half. The couple contacted the attorney general, who determined it would fall under the jurisdiction of the state’s Bureau of Labor and Industries. A spokesman for the bureau told PolitiFact the couple didn’t file their case with the agency, and we couldn’t find any evidence that the case was re-filed elsewhere. New York’s human rights law includes a provision that a person can be sent to jail for up to a year if they refuse to comply with an order. But we could not find any evidence that anyone had been sent to jail. A case against the Liberty Ridge Farm, a New York wedding venue that refused to host a wedding for a lesbian couple, remains pending. Lisa Hardaway, spokeswoman for Lambda Legal in New York, said she had never heard of jail time in such a case. ""This is an extreme scare tactic by opponents of equality for LGBT folks,"" she told PolitiFact in an email. ""It's a good talking point but not real."" Other cases that remain pending are in Washington state and New Mexico, where a photographer’s case is before the state Supreme Court. Our ruling After the Supreme Court rulings about gay marriage, Perkins said, ""We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail."" We didn't find cases where people were forced to participate against their will. However, if vendors refuse service, there are consequences. There are 21 states that forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation. Vendors who refuse service there could face legal actions and fines. The ""jail"" part of Perkins’ claim is an exaggeration. We couldn’t find any evidence that a vendor had been sent to jail or that any legal authority had threatened jail time. In some states, if a business owner loses an anti-discrimination case and refuses to comply with an order, the owner could face jail, but we found no evidence of that ever happening. One state, Colorado, specifically took action to remove the threat of jail. We rate this claim Half True.

175,pomt-10665,"Says he has ""the most impressive education record"" of the Republican candidates.",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/27/mike-huckabee/not-quite-the-best/,"Standing on a stage in Iowa, amid all his competitors for the Republican presidential primary, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee made a bold claim. Of all the candidates, he said, he owned ""the most impressive"" education record. ""We raised standards, we measured and we held people accountable for the results,"" he said. It might seem an easy thing to prove. He had 10 years of executive leadership under his belt, compared to Mitt Romney's four and Rudy Giuliani's eight. The others, of course, had none, leaving this a contest where only three could compete. Huckabee also had a pretty hefty resume behind him, including past chairmanships of the Education Commission of the States and the Southern Regional Education Board. And under his watch, he pushed for or signed legislation that improved Arkansas teacher pay, curriculum standards and education funding. The results were quite remarkable. As the Education Trust reports, Arkansas was the biggest gainer in fourth-grade math and second best in eighth-grade math over seven years of the national exam known as the ""nation's report card."" By the time of the debate, in fact, Huckabee had become the only Republican to be endorsed by the New Hampshire chapter of the National Education Association. But as is the case with all claims of being the best or worst of something, Huckabee's takes just a small amount of poking to find points that deflate the logic. First, consider Romney's record. Though in office a shorter time than Huckabee, Romney certainly can claim as strong, if not stronger, results. Massachusetts fourth- and eighth-graders rated first in the nation in both math and science on the ""nation's report card"" in both 2005 and 2007. Education Week rated Massachusetts as fifth on its 2007 ""chance for success"" index, compared to Arkansas' 39th. Second, consider Huckabee's critics, who say the former governor claims too much credit. Tom Kimbrell, a former superintendent who now heads the Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators, minces no words in assessing Huckabee's tenure: ""He was the governor of Arkansas, but as far as being part of the process, he was not present. There was no leadership at all."" Kimbrell, who was knee-deep in many of the state's education issues during Huckabee's tenure, said the Legislature and the state's education organizations made things happen on most key issues. And when Huckabee did press his views, such as on arts education and consolidation of small school districts, Kimbrell contended the results were not positive. Consolidation did not save money as promised, though it did disrupt many small rural communities. And a mandate for arts education came without funding and ended up as part of a lawsuit. Gary Ritter, an associate professor of education and public policy at the University of Arkansas, put it this way: ""He took unpopular stands in favor of strategies he believed would work. I'm not sure if they worked."" Did Huckabee act on education issues? Yes. Was his record the ""most impressive"" of the bunch? Romney certainly competes.

176,pomt-05952,"Says Mitt Romney ""was one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse"" Marco Rubio.",half-true,/florida/statements/2012/jan/25/marco-rubio/was-mitt-romney-one-first-endorse-marco-rubio/,"The battle for Hispanic voters in the Republican primary is turning ugly, and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is trying to tamp down some of the rancor. Rubio stepped in when Newt Gingrich went so far as to compare Republican rival Mitt Romney with -- prepare yourselves! -- Charlie Crist. ""We discovered last night that Mitt Romney has picked up Charlie Crist's campaign people,"" said Gingrich at a campaign stop in St. Petersburg on Jan. 24, 2012. ""That sort of tells you everything you needed to know about this contest."" Gingrich’s mention of Crist drew yelps and boos from the crowd at the Tick Tock Restaurant. Florida Republicans remember well that Crist left the party in 2010 to run as an independent for the U.S. Senate. The race between Gingrich and Romney has been inflamed by Spanish-language radio ads, web ads on the Drudge Report website and news reports on the conservative website Newsmax that said Romney was using Crist’s former campaign staff. Rubio was concerned enough about the attacks that he released a statement the same day. (Rubio has said he will not endorse in the race.) ""Mitt Romney is no Charlie Crist,"" Rubio said. ""Romney is a conservative, and he was one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse me. He came to Florida, campaigned hard for me and made a real difference in my race."" Rubio’s comments caught our attention, because our memory was that Romney endorsed relatively late in the race for U.S. Senate. We decided to dig into the archives to see if Romney was in fact ""one of the first national Republican leaders"" to endorse Rubio. To understand the full web of endorsements at work here, we’ll go back to the Republican presidential primary of 2008. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was then challenging U.S. Sen. John McCain and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for the nomination. In that race, Rubio endorsed Huckabee relatively early, in 2007. (Rubio was then speaker of the Florida House.) Crist, meanwhile, waited until just before the Florida primary in early 2008 to endorse McCain. McCain beat Romney in Florida and went on to win the nomination. In 2009, Rubio was widely considered a long-shot against Crist for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Party leadership got behind Crist early that year, while Rubio secured early endorsements from Huckabee and U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., a tea party favorite. Rubio built up his campaign through 2009. By spring of 2010, Rubio gained endorsements from former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. In March 2010, Romney was on book tour in Florida and was asked regularly about endorsing in the Crist-Rubio race. Romney said several times that he was undecided and generally didn’t endorse in primaries. By April, though, Crist’s campaign was in serious trouble. Polls showed he would likely lose. Crist further angered Republicans with a veto of a bill limiting teachers tenure on April 15. The news broke the next day that Romney was endorsing Rubio, and the official endorsement came April 19. When he made his endorsement, Romney was certain enough of Rubio’s position in the primary that he publicly urged Crist to stay in the Republican Party and accept a loss. Rubio went on to a decisive victory over Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek. We contacted representatives for both Romney and Rubio about this fact-check. Rubio’s staff said his comments spoke for themselves. The Romney campaign sent us the following statement: ""Sen. Marco Rubio is an outstanding advocate for fiscal responsibility and a principled voice for conservative values in the United States Senate. Gov. Romney was proud to support Senator Rubio in 2010 and honored to have campaigned with him across Florida."" Our ruling Rubio said that Romney was ""one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse me."" Romney did endorse Rubio before Crist dropped out of the primary in 2010. But it was clear at the time that Rubio would have thumped Crist in a primary if Crist hadn’t dropped out. The main point of Rubio’s comments was to lower the temperature in the Republican race. But it bears noting that Romney’s endorsement of Rubio was something less than a pioneering stand.

177,pomt-08017,Obama’s mid-term approval ratings are similar to other presidents who went on to re-election.,half-true,/virginia/statements/2011/jan/10/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-obamas-approval-ratings-fine-compar/,"With Democrats woozy from their shellacking in November’s congressional elections, political junkies are riveted on 2012 and whether President Barack Obama will win a second term. No one is putting a better spin on Obama’s fortunes than Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He wrote an end-of-the year column for Politico, a Washington news organization, saying Obama’s ""list of achievements already dwarfs that of many presidents."" Kaine, a former Virginia governor, encountered skepticism during a TV interview last Sunday. Ed Henry, CNN’s senior White House corespondent, noted Obama’s approval rating from voters dropped 6 percentage points in 2010. ""You made your case but it seems like the American people aren’t buying it, sir,"" Henry said. Kaine replied, ""Relatively, if you look at the president’s mid-term numbers compared to other presidents in their mid-term, he’s fine."" We decided to take a closer look. Kaine was responding to a Gallup poll conducted in the final week of December that showed 47 percent of adult Americans approved of Obama’s job performance, 45 percent disapproved and 8 percent were undecided. First, we asked for clarification of what Kaine meant when he said Obama is ""fine."" Alec Gerlach, a DNC press secretary, said Kaine meant Obama’s mid-term poll numbers ""are in the neighborhood of other presidents who got re-elected, including Reagan and Clinton."" So for this fact-check we will focus on whether Obama's ratings are indeed similar to presidents who got re-elected. Then we researched polls by Gallup because it has the longest record of tracking presidential popularity, dating to 1937 when Franklin Roosevelt was beginning his second term. We compared Obama’s numbers to the approval ratings other presidents received at the start of the year after mid-term congressional elections. To keep the comparison consistent, we turned to the first Gallup poll on Obama completely conducted in 2011. A survey from Jan. 2 to Jan. 4 found the president had 49 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval and 6 percent were undecided on his job perfromance. The average mid-term mark for presidents -- from Roosevelt in 1939 through Obama in 2011 -- is 53.5 percent approval, 36 percent disapproval and 10.5 percent undecided. Obama seems to be in the neighborhood, but not on the best street. Let’s look at the presidents who got reelected in that time span. Their average mid-term approval was 57 percent and disapproval was 35 percent. Obama is not in that school district. But neither were Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton midway through their first terms. Then they moved up quickly. Reagan was the least popular mid-term president. At the start of 1983, with the nation emerging from recession, he had 37 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval. Less than two years later, Reagan carried all but one state in a landslide reelection. Bill Clinton’s numbers at the start of 1995 were similar to Obama’s today. Clinton had 47 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval. In 1996, he was easily reelected. In contrast, George H.W. Bush had a robust 59 percent approval rating in early 1991 only to lose reelection the next year. All told, we were able to find the last 19 mid-term presidential polls by Gallup. Obama’s approval rating is the 11th highest. Of the eight presidents below him, four times their party retained the White House in the next election, and four times it didn’t. Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, says mid-term polls are a horrible gauge of coming elections because a president’s popularity can soar or plummet with events. ""They don’t say a thing,"" he said. ""The numbers that matter are the votes of people and, considering the beating Democrats took on Nov. 7, the president is by no means OK, assured of a successful term or a second one."" Let’s review. Kaine, with his spokesman’s elaboration, said Obama’s mid-term polling popularity is ""fine"" compared to other presidents who went on to re-election. Kaine is correct in saying that Obama’s numbers compare favorably to Reagan and Clinton. But the president’s mid-term approval rating -- gauged by the first poll completely conducted in the new mid-term year -- is 8 percentage points below the average of re-elected presidents since 1939. His disapproval rating is 10 percentage points above the average. We know those numbers can change in an instant. But when a politician is down by 8 or 10 percentage points, we say he’s behind but within striking distance.

It said that after Obama's inauguration, ""His first call to any head of state, as president, was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory."" We checked the accounts of Obama's first day and found some truth to the claim. According to a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, on the morning of Obama's first full day in office, Jan. 21, 2009, the president placed brief phone calls to four Middle Eastern leaders — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Jordan's King Abdullah and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ""He used this opportunity on his first day in office to communicate his commitment to active engagement in pursuit of Arab-Israeli peace from the beginning of his term, and to express his hope for their continued cooperation and leadership,"" Gibbs said in the statement. ""In the aftermath of the Gaza conflict, he emphasized his determination to work to help consolidate the ceasefire by establishing an effective anti-smuggling regime to prevent Hamas from rearming, and facilitating in partnership with the Palestinian Authority a major reconstruction effort for Palestinians in Gaza. He pledged that the United States would do its part to make these efforts successful, working closely with the international community and these partners as they fulfill their responsibilities as well. The President appreciated the spirit of partnership and warm nature of these calls."" Palestinian officials on the West Bank bragged that Obama called Abbas first. According to a story in Agence France Presse on Jan. 21, 2009, Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina quoted Obama as saying, ""This is my first phone call to a foreign leader and I'm making it only hours after I took office."" The spokesman said Obama vowed ""to work with him (Abbas) as partners to establish a durable peace in the region"" and that he (Obama) ""would deploy every possible effort to achieve peace as quickly as possible."" The New York Daily News wrote a story about the slippery diplomatic slope that comes along with things as small as who got called first. The story quotes a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy in Washington as saying his government had ""no idea"" who Obama called first; and that the White House was mum on the issue. We also got no response from the White House on the matter. But we think the issue of who got called minutes before someone else is irrelevant. The point is that Obama's first calls were to leaders of this region — all of them. The e-mail may be right that Obama called Abbas first. At the very least, Abbas was among the very first. But consider the context in which the statement was made, to back up the suggestion that Obama is actually a Muslim. Assuming Obama did call Abbas first — and again, we can't confirm that — we do know that one of his very next calls was to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

John Kasich took office in 2011.",half-true,/ohio/statements/2016/feb/22/cecile-richards/planned-parenthoods-ceo-says-half-ohios-abortion-c/,"Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, told a crowd of women in Los Angeles how she really feels about the idea of Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, winning the presidential election: ""It would be a complete and utter disaster."" She continued, ""Gov. Kasich has come off as a moderate, only by comparison to Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, but it’s really important to know in Ohio, more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down. He signed 17 separate bills to restrict reproductive access in the state."" We looked more closely to find out how many of Ohio’s abortion providers had closed, and whether it could be attributed to Kasich’s leadership. Ohio’s chapter of NARAL Pro-Choice America has been keeping tabs on clinic closings and openings. They say that since 2011, Kasich’s first year in office, eight of the 16 surgical abortion clinics have closed or stopped performing abortions. A new provider in Akron opened in the summer of 2015, bringing the total number of functioning surgical abortion clinics in the state to nine. PolitiFact Ohio confirmed NARAL’s tally of closings in Ohio, in chronological order: February 2011, the Mahoning Valley Women’s Center, Youngstown June 2012, Capital Care Network, Columbus April 2013, Capital Care Network, Akron October 2013, Center for Choice, Toledo October 2013, Cleveland Center for Women’s Health June 2014, Cleveland Surgi-Center August 2014, Complete Healthcare for Women, Columbus August 2014, Women’s Medical Center of Cincinnati They key legislation that caused at least four of the clinics to close was passed in Ohio’s 2013 budget (HB 59). Kasich signed into law regulations that equate to a Catch-22 for abortion providers. HB 59 requires all ambulatory surgical facilities to have a transfer agreement with a local hospital to admit patients in case of emergency. At the same time, the law prohibits public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements with abortion providers. H.B. 59, 130th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ohio 2013) In 2013, the New York Times wrote about Ohio’s changing climate for women’s reproductive rights. ""Ohio has become a laboratory for what anti-abortion leaders call the incremental strategy — passing a web of rules designed to push the hazy boundaries of Supreme Court guidelines without flagrantly violating them."" Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, put it more succinctly last year, when the Columbus Dispatch quoted him as saying, ""The goal is to end abortion."" The transfer agreement legislation shut down Toledo’s Center for Choice; the center was unable to get a transfer agreement from a private hospital after legislation outlawed their agreement with the public University of Toledo Medical Center. Today, their phone number forwards calls to a clinic in Michigan, the next-closest location for women seeking surgical abortions in the area. Likewise, the Women’s Medical Center of Cincinnati was denied an exception to their transfer agreement from the Ohio Health Department and went to court to fight the decision in Hamilton County. The center lost in court and closed in August 2014. A representative at Cleveland’s Surgi-Center told PolitiFact that when their location’s lease was up in July 2014, they had to move, which meant applying for a new ambulatory surgical center license through the Ohio Department of Health. ""Knowing all the problems other clinics were having,"" the Surgi-Center stopped performing abortions. They still provide reproductive health services like STD screening and birth control. The Cleveland Center for Women’s Health closed in 2013 and relocated to Detroit, Mich., where there are fewer regulations for clinics that do abortions. The other four shuttered abortion providers closed for reasons that are not as directly tied to state regulations. The Mahoning Valley center in Youngstown closed as a business decision, according to NARAL. The Capital Care Network location in Akron closed after state inspectors identified safety violations that temporarily halted services, and the provider opted to close rather than correct the issues. In Columbus, Capital Care merged with Founders’ Women’s Health, another abortion provider. Finally, according to NARAL, the doctors with Complete Healthcare for Women, who still provide complete women’s health care services other than surgical abortions, never gave an explanation for why they stopped performing the procedures after 2014. Our ruling Richards said that ""more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down."" PolitiFact confirmed that since 2011, seven abortion providers have closed and an eighth stopped performing surgical abortions. That’s half of the previous 16 providers in the state -- not more than half. Also, four of the eight providers closed for reasons associated with provisions in HB 59, which Kasich signed. But that law hasn’t been directly tied to the other four abortion providers’ decisions to shut down.

Citing a laundry-list of complaints, the Progressive Wisconsin Political Fund has been labeling Democratic incumbent Jeff Plale an ""Absolute Conservative."" Plale is facing Milwaukee County Supervisor Chris Larson in the Sept. 14 primary. The district is heavily Democratic, but ideologically split. That led to the outside groups joining the fray. On the anti-Plale side, the Progressive Wisconsin Political Fund has mailed a dozen or more pieces, with many using a replica of the Absolut vodka bottle. Plale, of South Milwaukee, says he is puzzled by the vodka bottle image. ""I don’t even like vodka,"" he said. Less confusing is the message in a piece labeled ""Welcome to Plale’s Playhouse,"" featuring a cartoonish version of Plale standing in a tree house under a sign: ""Typical Politicians Only!"" Citing several issues, the piece argues that Plale puts his own interests before taxpayers. It includes this claim: ""Last year, while many of his colleagues turned down a $2,500 pay raise because Wisconsin faced a deficit and our families faced tough economic times, Senator Plale pocketed the extra money."" As a source, the fund cites a Feb. 9, 2009 item from the St. Paul Pioneer Press, which itself is a reprint of a Wisconsin State Journal editorial from the day before. So did Plale take the money and run? Members of the state Assembly and Senate are paid $49,943. They received a $2,530 (5.06 percent) annual pay raise, which took effect in January 2009 and lasts for the current two-year legislative term. The raise amounts to about $210 a month. State lawmakers automatically got the increase to their salary -- a boost set by an administrative panel and approved by a bipartisan committee from both chambers. So there is no way to turn down the salary increase itself. ""I have to pay them their full salary,"" said Robert Marchant, Senate chief clerk and administrator. The raises come at a time when state employees -- but not state lawmakers -- are required to take 16 unpaid furlough days, eight in the fiscal year that started July 2009 and eight in the fiscal year that started July 2010. And with lots of private-sector employees taking recession-driven pay cuts, many state lawmakers have made a point of giving their raises back. In the Senate, 31 of the 38 members have returned the money in one form or another, according to Marchant. There are several ways to do this, from taking unpaid furlough days to simply writing a check and depositing it back in the state coffers. Others have given the money to charity, though there is no system for tracking that. Plale said he is taking 16 unpaid furlough days to ""give back"" his raise. ""That comes close to washing that out,"" Plale said. ""How can I ask my staff to take 16 unpaid work days and not do it myself?"" Will it even out in the end? According to Marchant, Plale in July 2009 began docking his monthly paycheck by $91.20. Over the course of two years, that will be the equivalent of 16 days of salary. From July of 2009 to Sept. 1, 2010, Plale had returned $1,276.90. Over the full two-year period, that would amount to $2,189, or 43 percent of the full raise. So what about the original claim, that Plale pocketed the money? Plale’s salary did go up, there was no way to stop that. He did not start giving the money back right away, as a few lawmakers did. Once other state employees were required to take furloughs, Plale imposed the same standard on himself -- long before the direct mail piece was sent. But that approach won’t account for the full raise, only about 43 percent of it.

That’s something he’s already done in his county, State Republican Chairman Edward F. Cox said. ""He has really done very well in each of the offices he’s held, particularly as the county executive of Dutchess County, where he has cut taxes, his budget now is lower than it was six years ago,"" Cox said in a radio interview. Molinaro has been the top elected official in Dutchess County since 2012. He has been a vocal critic of Medicaid and unfunded mandates from the state that drive up local property taxes. He wants the state to shoulder more of the cost for those services. At the same time, he wants to cut state spending to keep state taxes low. Is Cox right that Molinaro has already cut spending and property taxes in Dutchess County? Property Taxes A spokesperson for Cox pointed to the county’s approved budgets while Molinaro’s been in office. This year’s budget in Dutchess County reduced both the county property tax rate for residents and the tax levy for the fourth consecutive year, according to budget documents. But his first two budgets increased property taxes by about 2 percent in 2013 and again in 2014. The lower tax rates and levies don’t mean property taxes have gone down for every resident in Dutchess County. Property tax bills are a combination of taxes levied by the county and each municipality. While the county’s tax levy has gone down, some local taxes may have increased. Property taxes levied by Poughkeepsie, for example, rose by 16.5 percent in 2017. Total spending Dutchess County spending, on the other hand, has gone up every year Molinaro has been in office. Total spending increased by about 6 percent between his first budget and 2017, according to the county's budget office. Total spending for 2018 won't be known until next year. Part of that is mandated spending by the state. Budget documents show the cost of mandated services has increased by close to $3 million since 2015. Cox’s spokesperson said he was thinking about the county’s workforce when he said total spending was down in Dutchess County. Molinaro has approved cuts in the county workforce since taking office. Budget documents show the county planned to employ 1,753 full-time employees in 2018, down from 1,823 when Molinaro took office. Our ruling Cox said Molinaro has cut taxes and spending as Dutchess County Executive. He’s right that county property taxes are lower. But spending has risen more than 6 percent since Molinaro's first budget. Cox’s claim is partially accurate. On balance, we rate it Half True.

Gillespie, meanwhile, co-founded his lobbying firm in 2000 with Democrat Jack Quinn, a former chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore. On Nov. 10, 2004, Quinn Gillespie and Associates signed a six-month contract, worth $510,000, with the Ivory Coast to improve the nation’s relations with the United States. Among other things, the firm agreed to organize a visit to Washington for Gbagbo and meetings with U.S. leaders. You won’t find Gillespie’s signature on the contract, however. That’s because he was absent from the firm for almost two years when the contract was signed, according to Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman. Logan said Gillespie went on leave in January 2003 to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee and didn’t return until March 2005. The contract and the firm’s subsequent federal disclosure that it was representing a foreign agent was signed by Quinn. The firm’s work for Gbagbo started Dec. 22, 2004 and ended June 30, 2005, according to a disclosure statement it filed with the U.S. Department of Justice. Jeffrey Connaughton, then vice chairman of Quinn Gillespie, told The New Yorker in 2012 that firm was hoping to demonstrate that Gbagbo was willing to have free and fair elections. Those hopes soured, the article said, when Connaughton flew to the Ivory Coast, met with Gbagbo, and concluded the leader ""had no interest in democracy -- he just wanted P.R."" Connaughton sent us a statement, which he also gave to The Washington Post, saying Gillespie made it ""clear"" when the firm started that he would not represent foreign governments. ""He was at the RNC when I decided to take the lead on Ivory Coast, so if anyone had checked with (the firm) or me, we would have confirmed that Ed had absolutely nothing to do with it."" Gbagbo finally agreed to hold elections in November 2010, but lost to Alassane Ouattara, refused to give up power and ignited a civil war. Gbagbo was arrested in May when French and rebel forces took control of the capital, Abidjan. He has been sent to The Hague, where International Criminal Court has charged him with four counts of being an indirect co-perpetrator of violent acts committed his troops. Human Rights Watch estimates at least 3,000 people were killed and 150 women were raped during the six-month crisis. Other nations Warner’s ad also flashes the flags of four other countries it says Gillespie’s firm represented. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman, backed the claim by sending us Quinn Gillespie disclosure forms. They showed the company worked for: Pakistan from April 2006 to April 2008 Costa Rica from a few weeks near the end of 2006 Macedonia from April 2007 to April 2008 Bosnian Serb Republic from January 2007 through December 2007 The firm reported earning a total of $3 million from all five nations. For perspective, Quinn Gillespie was paid $52.3 million by domestic clients from 2006 to 2008, according OpenSecrets.org. The payments from foreign nations came to 5.4 percent of the firm’s revenues during the three years. Gillespie says he’s never personally lobbied for a foreign government and the records back him up. Disclosure forms filed by the firm do not list him on its lobbying team for any of the nations. The teams generally had Democratic lobbyists, as indicated by their campaign donations, which were part of the disclosures. Gillespie left the firm in June 2007 to work in President George W. Bush’s administration. The company continued its relationship with Bosnia and Macedonia after his departure and signed new contracts with Japan and Indonesia. Our ruling Warner’s ad says Gillespie’s ""firm lobbied for five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting trial for war crimes."" The ad -- which is carefully worded -- has a point that Gillespie’s firm lobbied for five foreign governments, including the Ivory Coast, whose former ruler, Gbagbo, is awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court. But the ad’s effort to link Gillespie to a brutal dictator lacks important context. Gillespie had been on leave from the firm for more than a year when the Ivory Coast deal was signed. None of the company’s federal disclosures indicate Gillespie was involved in the representation of any foreign clients, and Gbagbo was charged with crimes against humanity for events that happened in 2010 and 2011, well after the firm’s relationship with the Ivory Coast ended. While there’s accuracy to Warner’s claim, it leaves out vital details. We rate it Half True.",None,Mark Warner,None,None,None,2014-10-24T12:03:23,2014-10-20,['None']

The latest instance began with Arianna Huffington, founder of the liberal Huffington Post, talking on ABC's This Week about the causes of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. ""The truth is that right now we have precisely the regulatory system that the Bush-Cheney Administration wanted -- full of loopholes, full of cronies and lobbyists filling the very agencies they're supposed to be overseeing,"" she said, adding a bit later, ""Right here, we have the poster child of Bush-Cheney crony capitalism. Halliburton (was) involved in this, and we haven't said (anything) about that. They after all were responsible for cementing the well. Here's Halliburton, after it defrauded the American taxpayer (of) hundreds of millions of dollars is involved again..."" That's when conservative pundit Liz Cheney interrupted. ""Arianna, I don't know what planet you live on ..."" she said, starting interruptions and crosstalk that finally ended with this: Cheney: ""Her assertion that Halliburton defrauded the U.S. government --"" Huffington: ""It did. It did."" Cheney: ""-- that it was Bush-Cheney cronyism -- these are the left's talking points --"" Huffington: ""It did -- hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq."" Cheney: ""Arianna, it is absolutely not true. It is absolutely not true."" Huffington: ""Okay, I'm so glad PolitiFact is going to be checking this. I'm so glad."" Cheney: ""Good, good."" There is no dispute that Halliburton was a contractor on the Deepwater Horizon rig, which is what Huffington was alluding to when she said Halliburton was ""involved"" in the oil spill. Host Jake Tapper affirmed that, then Cheney indicated she was objecting specifically to the claim of fraud. So we decided to fact-check Huffington's statement that Halliburton defrauded the U.S. government of ""hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq."" We first want to note something not explicitly stated on the show: Former Vice President Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton before becoming vice president, and Liz Cheney is his daughter. And we'll also stipulate that there is a mountain of evidence that many American companies profited off of the government's inefficient contracting system during the rebuilding of Iraq. Dick Cheney was secretary of defense from 1989 to 1993, during the administration of President George H.W. Bush. A few years after leaving office, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Halliburton, a Houston-based oil services company. He led Halliburton until 2000, when he left to run for vice president on a ticket with George W. Bush. The Iraq war began a few years later. Most of the allegations of waste involving Halliburton focus on a subsidary company that Halliburton acquired in 1962, then known as Brown & Root. A series of mergers under Halliburton's ownership led to its current name, Kellogg, Brown & Root, or KBR. Halliburton's KBR held one of the largest contracts given during the Iraq war effort, the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or LOGCAP, which was part of the trend of government outsourcing traditionally military duties to the private sector. (We're focusing on the LOGCAP contract in this report because it's the contract that has the potential for ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in fraud. There have been other isolated allegations of fraud that involved significantly smaller amounts.) The history of KBR's LOGCAP contracts are documented in Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience, a 2009 report prepared by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction: ""Just as USAID had outsourced much of its work in the years after the Cold War, the military also had turned to the private sector to perform work once done by its own personnel. Under the LOGCAP contract, which KBR held for all but a few years since the program's inception in 1985, contractors provide services ranging from building bases to cooking food and doing laundry. LOGCAP grew out of the post-Vietnam downsizing of the armed services, reflecting the government-wide growth of outsourcing, which would dramatically affect the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. In World War II, one contractor was deployed for every seven soldiers. During the 2003 invasion, that number had increased to one for every 2.4. By 2006, contractors outnumbered soldiers in Iraq."" The report noted that some government officials raised the concern of a potential conflict of interest because of Cheney's former position with Halliburton, but that ""White House officials said the mission took priority over whatever political fallout might occur"" from awarding contracts to KBR. Since winning the latest version of the LOGCAP contract in 2001, the government has ordered work from KBR worth more than $31 billion. Government officials have raised many questions about KBR's fulfillment of its contracts, everything from billing for meals it didn't serve to charging inflated prices for gas to excessive administrative costs. Government auditors have noted that KBR refused to turn over electronic data in its native format and stamped documents as proprietary and secret when the documents would normally be considered public records. Over the course of several years, the Defense Contract Audit Agency found that $553 million in payments should be disallowed to KBR, according to 2009 testimony by agency director April Stephenson before the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Commissioner Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore Law School, said that amount represents a small portion of everything that auditors examined as potentially questionable. ""The DCAA is known for cautious conclusions about contracting,"" Tiefer said. ""The large majority of those auditor findings get actually withheld from the contractor."" KBR itself acknowleges it may not get paid for all of its contract services. In its most recent annual report filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, it acknowledged that the Defense Contract Audit Agency was recommending withholding $289 million in contract costs not yet paid and asking for the return of $121 million already paid. ""We continue to work with our administrative contracting officers, the DCAA and our subcontractors to resolve these issues. However, for certain of these matters, we have filed claims with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Claims,"" the report states. But there is one notable allegation where KBR is being accused of fraud, that KBR ""knowingly included impermissible costs"" in its bills. In April 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil fraud case against KBR over the issue of using private security forces in Iraq to protect its workers and subcontractors. Private security wasn't allowed under the LOGCAP contract because the U.S. military was supposed to provide protection. The lawsuit alleges that internal documents showed KBR executives knew private security wasn't allowed but charged for it anyway. While the lawsuit doesn't put a dollar amount on those billings, the director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency said the total could come to $99 million or higher. KBR has denied wrongdoing and said in a response to the lawsuit that the government has known for years that KBR was hiring private security, and KBR only did so because its employees were being left unprotected by the military. ""KBR believes the costs incurred and actions taken by the company and its subcontractors to provide support and to protect its employees and subcontractors were reasonable, necessary and appropriate under the contractual arrangement between KBR and the Army. ... The Army breached the contract by repeatedly failing to provide the necessary force protection,"" the statement said. ""Since 2001, KBR and its employees and subcontractors have worked diligently, and at often times at great sacrifice, to support American troops serving in Iraq,"" it also said. We should note here that KBR workers have died in Iraq. Company officials said 74 people working on the LOGCAP III contract have died in Iraq between 2003 and 2010. Halliburton sold KBR in 2007. Halliburton officials said KBR's war contracts weren't adding much to the oil company's profits. The same year, Halliburton opened a ""second headquarters"" (their words) in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to emphasize its identity as a worldwide oil services company. But Halliburton did own KBR during the height of KBR's activities in Iraq. The Department of Justice fraud lawsuit specifically stipulates that KBR was overcharging between 2003 and 2006, years that Halliburton owned the company. We asked Halliburton for comment on this report, and they sent us this statement: ""Halliburton cannot comment on activity that relates to KBR's work in Iraq and Afghanistan as it would be inappropriate for Halliburton to comment on the merits of a matter affecting only the interest of KBR."" The U.S. government continues to use KBR for contract work in Iraq. In fact, the U.S. Army recently granted additional work worth $568 million to KBR in May. Military officials said it would be too disruptive to change contractors at this point in the process. Indeed, one defense of KBR's work is that they take extra steps -- which some might call excessive -- to keep troops happy with extra amenities at the request of military commanders. Recently, government officials have warned that KBR is dragging its feet on withdrawing its personnel from Iraq; the company's withdrawal rate significantly lags that of the military itself. If KBR doesn't reduce its employees in Iraq quicker, the U.S. government could be overbilled by as much as $193 million in 2010, officials said during hearings held by the Commission on Wartime Spending in Iraq and Afghanistan. In evaluating Huffington's statement, we're most bothered by her use of the word ""defrauded."" Some of the overbilling in Iraq appears to have been done from haste or inefficiency, or even in a desire to please military officials in the field without regard for cost. Whether the waste in contracting constitutes fraud is still being examined. ""It's a lot money being spent in a region of the world where we don't have a lot of infrastructure for accounting for how the money is being spent. It will take years before we fully determine how we spent the money,"" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. In ruling on Huffington's statement, we find much in the public record to support her statement, most notably the Justice Department lawsuit. Certainly there have been hundreds of millions of dollars that Halliburton's KBR attempted to charge the government that have been denied. Government audits of KBR's work in Iraq will likely continue for some time, and we do not expect a final accounting on these fronts anytime soon. Huffington glossed over some of these points in her back and forth with Liz Cheney. There's also much evidence that makes us believe that hundreds of millions of dollars were lost to waste and inefficiency, not deceitful fraud.

184,pomt-09838,"""If you're over 65 years old in America today, you have no choice but to be in Medicare. Even if you want out of Medicare, you have to forfeit your Social Security to get out of it.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/24/dick-armey/dick-armeys-claim-about-medicare-and-social-securi/,"To demonstrate how much control the government already has over our health care system, former House Republican Leader Dick Armey made this comment about Medicare on a recent episode of the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer : Senior citizens ""see this as a hostile government takeover of all health care, where they will be forced into a government-run program, and their health care lives will be managed by the government, just as today's the case in Medicare,"" Armey, currently chair of FreedomWorks, a conservative activist group, said on the Aug. 13, 2009, episode. ""If you're over 65 years old in America today, you have no choice but to be in Medicare. Even if you want out of Medicare, you have to forfeit your Social Security to get out of it."" We wondered if the rules for Medicare were are rigid as Armey described, and, as usual with government programs, we found it's more complicated than we expected. First, we wanted to find out how Medicare enrollment works. According to the Social Security Web site, anyone who files for Social Security benefits at the age of 62 is automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A and B — coverage for hospital and doctor's visits, respectively — at the age of 65. Patients must enroll independently for private coverage or prescription drug benefits. In some cases, people never sign up for retirement benefits and therefore they must enroll in Medicare on their own, said Dorothy Clark, spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. Either way, ""Medicare is a voluntary program,"" said Clark. No one is ever required to sign up for government health benefits, nor are they required to keep them. Nevertheless, Armey is right that beneficiaries collecting Social Security will lose those payments if they drop Medicare Part A — so long as they were enrolled in both programs in the first place, Clark said. We were curious why Social Security and Medicare are linked, and when we asked, we found that the issue is the matter of a lawsuit that was brought against the Social Security Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services in 2008. Among the plaintiffs is none other than Dick Armey. The plaintiffs argue that, under the Medicare Act signed in 1965 and under the Social Security Act, there are no rules requiring enrollment in Medicare Part A to receive retirement benefits. Rather, a series of subsequent policy statements have linked the two programs, which are illegal because the two departments did not follow the traditional procedure to write the new rules, according to a press release issued by the plaintiffs on Oct. 9, 2008. The policy essentially traps retirees into participating. We asked the plaintiff's lawyer, Kent Masterson Brown, why the government had done this and he had a simple answer: power. ""That's the curiosity here,"" Brown said. ""[The departments] want to control every body."" It turns out the NewsHour got a few viewer inquires angry that host Judy Woodruff did not do enough to challenge Armey on that point, according to Michael Getler, PBS ombudsman. Instead, Woodruff asked the other guest, Richard Kirsch with the liberal advocacy group Health Care for America Now, to challenge Armey's claim, but he didn't offer a specific rebuttal, leaving Armey's claim up in the air. So, back to Armey's claim. He's wrong that Medicare is required for everyone over the age of 65, but he's correct that those who want out of the program will lose their Social Security benefits as well. To us, that's a clear-cut Half True.",None,Dick Armey,None,None,None,2009-08-24T14:35:11,2009-08-13,"['United_States', 'Medicare_(United_States)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']"

A television ad by the Chamber puts the viewer on the front of a train, roaring past billboards proclaiming Kaine’s shortcomings. Among its claims: that Kaine, as governor, supported ""higher energy costs for families."" As proof, the chamber sent us Kaine’s testimony before a U.S. Senate hearing on climate change and the Chesapeake Bay in 2007. Kaine warned that rising temperatures and sea levels would damage the bay and the Hampton Roads region, and he urged the Senate to take action. ""I support legislation that includes a cap-and-trade program for emissions of all greenhouse gases, imposes economy-wide controls rather than singling out a particular sector, and accounts for state efforts to standardize methodologies to record and measure greenhouse gas emissions through the Climate Registry,"" he said. Soon after his testimony, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, at the time a Democrat from Connecticut, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., introduced a bill to implement a cap-and-trade system. Previous cap-and-trade bills were introduced in 2003 and 2005. Kaine did not say that he specifically supported a particular bill. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who introduced the legislation in 2003, said when the 2007 bill was put in the hopper, ""The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies. Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life."" Under cap and trade, the government would limit the allowable emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Companies that emit carbon dioxide, such as electric utilities, would either have to reduce emissions by using cleaner technology, or obtain credits from the government - either given or sold through an auction - to exceed limits. The government could use the revenues in any number of ways, including paying for general expenses, developing new energy-efficiency programs and giving rebates to ratepayers. In the 2007 bill, the national cap on carbon dioxide declined gradually from 5,775 million metric tons in 2012 to 1,732 million metric tons in 2050. The cost to consumers was analyzed by several government and non-government entities. The Energy Information Administration concluded that the 2007 legislation would cause gas prices to go up by 22 to 49 cents a gallon in 2020. And that would increase to 41 to 101 cents per gallon higher in 2030. Meanwhile, depending on the development of technology to capture and store carbon emissions, the average annual cost of household energy bills would increase by between $30 to $325 in 2020, and between $76 to $723 in 2030. Although the EIA does not make estimates beyond 2030, it says the costs would continue to escalate. The Environmental Protection Agency ran its own numbers. It said mandates to manufacture cleaner fuels would cause gas prices to rise by 53 cents a gallon in 2030 and by $1.40 a gallon in 2050. The EPA also projected that electricity prices would increase 44 percent in 2030 and 26 percent in 2050. Kaine spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said that equating support for cap-and-trade legislation with support for ""higher energy prices for families"" is ""ludicrous."" She said Kaine supports cap and trade as part of a ""package of larger reforms"" that would ""reduce our dependence on carbon-heavy energy sources and encourage the development of alternative energy and conservation."" She noted that some cap-and-trade proposals would have funneled proceeds from auctions back to consumers in rebates. Under a 2009 bill backed by President Barack Obama, the CBO said those in the lowest 20 percent of earners would save about $40 in 2020, a statistic Hoffine cited. But the CBO also said other households would pay more for electricity, averaging $175 more and up to about $340 more, because they would receive smaller rebates and use more electricity than low-income families. Hoffine also pointed to a study about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state compact for a cap and trade system. The system was put into place in 2009 and was evaluated after three years. The Analysis Group found that consumers saved a net of $1.1 billion compared to what the grid systems would have been without the cap-and-trade system, primarily because the states put auction proceeds toward energy efficiency programs. But ratepayers actually spent about 0.7 percent more for electricity up front. ""In general, it is true that controlling carbon emissions or other pollution from energy will raise the cost of energy relative to not controlling that pollution,"" Adele Morris, fellow and policy director in climate and energy economics at The Brookings Institution, said in an email. But ""the cap and trade approach is a substitute for other, more costly, ways to regulate greenhouse gases. Right now, because cap-and-trade didn't pass, the EPA is pursuing regulation of those emissions under its existing Clean Air Act authority, which means command and control approaches to regulation."" The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the successor to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, has issued fact sheets on several proposals for cap-and-trade legislation and programs. ""Others have claimed that the bill will have no cost impact, but this ignores the very real economic costs of shifting to a clean energy economy,"" the center said of the 2009 bill. The Lieberman-Warner bill in 2007 proposed to auction some of the credits to pay for renewable technologies, workforce training and low-income energy assistance, while giving the rest to states and other recipients. The legislation was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate that year. Our ruling The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says in a TV ad that Kaine supported ""higher energy costs for families."" It’s clear, as the Chamber notes in small print, that Kaine backs the concept of cap-and-trade legislation, but there’s no record of his support for a specific bill or proposal. Analyses of two measures that have been before in Congress in recent years concluded that cap-and-trade carries a cost for most consumers. At least one cap-and-trade program in place has resulted in an average lower cost for consumers through energy efficiency and rebates. And cap-and-trade legislation is one of the least expensive options for controlling greenhouse gases, experts said. So the assertion that cap and trade leads to higher energy prices is reasonable but depends on the specifics of a plan. The chamber cannot point to an instance where Kaine directly supported a particular measure that would raise energy bills, which is necessary context. There is an element of truth and a great deal of hyperbole in the chamber’s claim that Kaine supported higher energy bills for families.

""The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!"" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s Feb. 5 tweet came shortly after Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party leader, talked about the NHS march and universal health care on Fox & Friends, warning Americans it would be ""politically impossible"" to remove such a system once introduced. Trump thanked the network on Twitter for ""exposing the truth"" shortly after Farage’s appearance. We wondered how accurate Trump’s claim was that people joined the NHS march because the UK’s universal health care system ""is going broke and not working."" We looked at the origins of the march and recent polling statistics about British public opinion on the National Health Service, commonly called the NHS. We also looked at the current funding situation, since Trump’s claim suggests it’s losing money. We found that Trump’s tweet gives a misleading impression about how the British public feels about its health care system. Public support for NHS University of North Carolina health policy professor and deputy director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, Thomas C. Ricketts, told PolitiFact that the NHS probably has higher public support than any other government program in the UK. Public support for the NHS being maintained in its current form remains high according to a poll by Ipsos; 77 percent of people support this, while 9 in 10 people think the founding principles of the NHS should still apply to services today. Two-thirds of adults are willing to pay more of their own taxes to pay for the NHS. In a poll by YouGov last year, 84 percent of people were in favor of the service continuing to be run by the public sector. Helen Howson, the director of the Bevan Commission, an independent think tank for health in Wales, is working to find ways to improve the system while maintaining the principles set out at its founding. ""The NHS is a service which was set up to ensure that no one would be disadvantaged on the basis of their ability to pay, and people are passionate about these principles,"" she said. The NHS march, officially named, ""NHS in crisis: Fix it now"" was organized by the People’s Assembly, an independent, national campaign against austerity and Health Campaigns Together, a coalition defending the NHS. This year marks 70 years of NHS existence in the U.K., but the health care system has gone through what has been described as the worst winter in its recent history. The lack of funding is often blamed on austerity measures put forth by the Conservative Party and there have been concerns raised over privatizing parts of the system. Trump’s comments regarding the demonstration received immediate response by British officials, such as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said people were marching because they love the NHS and hate what is being happening to it by the current party in power. Health minister Jeremy Hunt, who was largely blamed for the severe lack of winter funding, hit back at Trump’s remarks, writing on Twitter that not one of the marchers ""wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover."" Growing concerns This is not to say that people don’t have concerns about the NHS. In a poll released last summer by the British Medical Association, more people are unhappy with the NHS than satisfied for the first time in the public poll run by British doctors. It showed that 70 percent of people think the health service is going in the wrong direction. The poll shows that 43 percent of respondents are dissatisfied with the service, which is double the number of dissatisfaction percentage in only two years. About 33 percent of respondents say they are satisfied. The poll also concluded that 82 percent of people are worried about the future of the NHS, 62 percent expect the NHS to get worse in the coming years and only 13 percent think that it will improve. The leading concerns of the respondents included a lack of funding, the possibility that the NHS may cease to be free at the point of use, increased waiting times and a lack of attention given to the service because of Brexit. Democrats’ push Trump also claimed that Democrats are pushing a similar health care plan to the NHS in the United States. Democrats have devised plans ranging from a total-government ""Medicare for all,"" also known as a single-payer health system, to a more limited ""public option"" that pits individual government-run plans up against private insurance for people who weren’t able to find affordable coverage in Obamacare. The latter allows Americans to gain access to government insurance alongside private health care plans. The current version of Obamacare, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act, has little resemblance to the NHS, where the government owns most of the hospitals and clinics, and doctors and nurses are government employees. Our ruling Trump said, ""The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!"" While the NHS has lost funding over the years, the march that took place was not in opposition to the service, but a call to increase funding and stop austerity cuts towards health and social care. The march resulted because people want universal health care to work better, not because they want it taken over by the private sector.

That’s $3 billion more than what former Governor Jim Doyle spent on transportation over the same period of time."" Walker has made the same claim for at least 11 months, on Twitter, in a weekly radio address, in media interviews and in public appearances. The numbers The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau told us it’s possible to reach Walker’s figures by considering the total raw dollars put toward transportation programs, including a double-count of the principal in terms of money borrowed. That is, Walker’s method counts the principal at the time money was borrowed, and counts it again when repayments are made on that debt. That method shows Walker’s eight years of DOT funding, in raw dollars, including bonding and subsequent debt service payments, at $25.8 billion -- $3.4 billion more than Doyle. But besides doing the double counting, that measure also fails to take into account inflation. So, it is problematic in two ways. Here are the fiscal bureau numbers without the double counting but including inflation: Governor Period Real DOT funding Difference Jim Doyle 2003-’11 $18.7 billion +$1.3 billion Scott Walker 2011-’19 $17.4 billion Those figures show that Doyle, in real dollars, spent more on transportation than Walker has. We ran into a similar issue when Walker said in February 2017 the state is ""investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin."" Our rating was Mostly False, since it didn’t take into account inflation, which is the best way to measure amounts over time. Our rating Walker says ""we invested"" in our transportation system ""$24 billion over eight years. That’s $3 billion more than what former Governor Jim Doyle spent on transportation over the same period of time."" Walker’s claim uses raw dollars and counts the total amount of bonding, debt service and all funds put toward transportation. But that double-counts the principal and ignores inflation. Excluding the double counting and taking into account inflation -- that is, real dollars spent on transportation -- Doyle actually spent more in his eight years than Walker has in his. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False.

188,pomt-12144,"Says that compared to Rick Baker's time as mayor, Kriseman ""had wet weather events that he did not experience"" that caused sewage spills. Baker ""went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor.""",mostly false,/florida/statements/2017/aug/10/rick-kriseman/was-weather-during-krisemans-term-perfect-storm-se/,"St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman has deflected some blame for the city’s sewage problem onto Mother Nature, saying opponent and former Mayor Rick Baker had an easier time avoiding sewage spills because he didn’t face as much severe rain. The sewage crisis has become the central issue of the Aug. 29 primary election, exacerbated by the 2015 closure of the Albert Whitted Water Reclamation Facility on the downtown waterfront. The decision to close the plant was made by City Council in 2011 and carried out in 2015 by the Kriseman administration. Since the plant’s closure, the city has been whipped by severe storms, prompting the release of millions of gallons of sewage into the bay. A Tampa Bay Times story in June uncovered a large disparity in the amount of sewage spilled during Baker’s two terms and Kriseman’s first. About 1.5 million gallons spilled under Baker in nine years, and 186 million gallons spilled under Kriseman through the 2015-16 summers. Kriseman acknowledged the difference but argued Baker benefited from better weather conditions. ""Clearly, there is no comparison in the numbers,"" Kriseman told the Times in June. ""But we also had wet weather events that he did not experience. He went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor. ""When you don't have significant rain events, and you're still having spills, you still need to take a look at your system."" In the weeks since that interview, Kriseman has accepted responsibility for his response to the sewage crisis. We were still intrigued by Kriseman’s explanation to the reporter. So we checked out whether it really did rain more under Kriseman, whether there was more drought under Baker, and what effect the weather really played in the system spilling nearly 124 times more under Kriseman than Baker. After consulting climatologists and the campaigns, here’s what we found out: The rainfall under Kriseman was only slightly worse than under Baker. Most importantly, Kriseman’s claim overlooks the consequence of his own decisionmaking and its connection to millions of gallons of spilled sewage. Kriseman’s rain totals The average annual rainfall at Albert Whitted Airport was higher during Kriseman’s term, but not by as much as he made it sound. According to data compiled by the National Weather Service, from 2001-09 the average annual rainfall at Albert Whitted airport was about 45.4 inches. The average rainfall under Kriseman’s three years was about 53.74 inches. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Average rainfall can be useful to understand part of the story. But excessive rain events (such as high flooding, tropical storms and hurricanes) are also relevant to consider, said Dustin Norman with the National Weather Service, given the underlying issue of sewage capacity. ""If you get an inch and a half a day for 30 days that’s way different than 40 inches in one day,"" Norman said. The city has been hit with several big storms since 2015 when the first major spill of Kriseman’s tenure occurred. In 2015, nearly 15 inches of rain fell between mid July and early August, causing the city to release 31.5 million gallons of untreated and partially treated sewage. Tropical Storm Colin hit the next summer, leading to 10 million gallons being dumped or spilled in June 2016. The worst event for the sewer system was Hurricane Hermine, which swamped aging sewer pipes in 2016 with 8.1 inches of rain. St. Petersburg reported spilling at least 151 million gallons of sewage as a result of Hermine — officials were unable to give a more exact tally because of a broken flow meter. How Baker fared with wet weather events Four hurricanes struck Florida in 2004. Tampa Bay avoided a direct hit but received a large amount of rainfall. The Tampa-St. Petersburg area got 12 to 14 inches of rain in August 2004, which experts said was notably high. ""The first part of (Kriseman's) statement, that ‘we had wet wet periods he did not experience,’ may be an overstatement,"" said David Zierden, a state climatologist at the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. ""I do know that August of 2004 was very wet, with the Tampa-St. Pete getting 12-14 inches that month."" Since that is considered high, we wanted to know the typical monthly rainfall total for the Albert Whitted Airport and how many times a month exceeded it. Daniel Brouillette, a climate services specialist at Florida State University, helped us out by compiling monthly rainfall totals from the airport from January 1987 to December 2016. He considered any monthly total that was more than two standard deviations greater than the mean monthly total — 11.14 inches of rain — as ""extremely wet."" Under Kriseman, five of his 43 months in office exceeded the mean of 11.14 inches (about 11.6 percent of his months). Under Baker, eight of his 105 months in office (or about 7.6 percent) exceeded the mean. So Kriseman experienced a greater percentage of ""extremely wet"" months, but not dramatically so. Decades of inadequate maintenance, and a consequential plant closure The Tampa Bay Times obtained a draft report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission last month that places much of the blame for the city's 200-million gallon sewage spill crisis on the administration of Kriseman, as well as the past two decades of city leadership, which includes the Baker administration from 2001-10. In particular, it pointed to the closure of the Albert Whitted plant in April 2015 and the Kriseman’s failure to reopen the plant to alleviate the sewage crisis after the heavy rains of August 2015. Kriseman and his team have described the rain events of 2015 as ""historic,"" ""unprecedented"" or a ""100-year event."" But investigators said those descriptions ""were not based in fact or reality,"" as the amount of rainfall Pinellas received in 2015 happened every 10-15 years, and the greater 2016 amount occurred every 25-30 years. A representative from the commission cautioned that the draft was not official, and said that the investigation is ongoing. How the mayors’ dry spells compare Baker experienced a couple of notable periods of drought at the very beginning and end of his tenure. Kriseman’s team said the mayor’s point about Baker going through ""significant periods of drought"" is bolstered by Baker referring to a 2002 drought in his 2011 book The Seamless City. ""During my terms, the issues that generated the single largest number of complaints came in 2002 during a drought."" Baker wrote. Kriseman’s team also provided PolitiFact with a 2007 Water Resources Department memo that talked about water restrictions in the city because of the lack of rainfall. Brian Fuchs, an associate geoscientist and climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center, compiled a time series of drought data for Pinellas County from 2000 to Aug. 2, 2017. Yellow bars indicate abnormally dry conditions. (The county level is the smallest geographic point the Drought Monitor can address.) Baker encountered the tail end of the worst period of drought in Pinellas County when he took office in April 2001. The eight-month 2000-01 stretch was the worst drought of the last 17 years (when the Drought Monitor began collecting data). But drought conditions lifted that summer, and there was no drought for the next five years. And after a three-week period of minimal drought for just 1 percent of the county in the summer of 2006, the county remained drought free until January 2007. The county experienced periods of moderate drought in 2007 and 2008, but none that matched the intensity of 2000-01. The year 2009 saw periods of moderate and severe drought but could not be considered extreme, according to the Monitor. Flash forward to Kriseman’s first term. Kriseman’s first two years were relatively normal. Then in late 2016, after the bad storms, moderate drought covered the entire county. ""Overall, both mayors had both wet and drought periods during their tenures in office,"" Brouillette said. Our ruling Kriseman addressed the disparity between sewage spilled under his administration and Baker’s by saying, ""We also had wet weather events that (Baker) did not experience. He went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor."" Kriseman's explanation is exaggerated. Experts told us the weather was only slightly more favorable to Baker than Kriseman. Both mayors experienced significant rain events and some drought. While heavy rains played a role in the sewage spills, both the handling of the Albert Whitted plant as well as decades of city neglect put St. Petersburg's massive sewage problems into motion. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. So we rate this claim Mostly False.

189,pomt-06869,"In contrast to President Barack Obama, who ""is not acting presidential,"" President Ronald Reagan ""would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on — that's how much he revered the presidency.""",mostly false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/01/ken-langone/wall-street-figure-ken-langone-blasts-obama-unpres/,"Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot and a well-known Wall Street figure, took a shot at President Barack Obama during a July 28, 2011, roundtable segment on CNBC, the business-focused cable network. ""Let me make it very clear, and I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of hate mail because of this, and that’s okay,"" Langone said. ""I think our sitting president is acting so unpresidential …. He is dividing us as a nation. He is not bringing us together. He’s willfully dividing us. He’s petulant. ... ""The reality is we believe in a government of three legs, all equal. So if (House Speaker John) Boehner and (Senate Majority Leader Harry) Reid -- well, Reid will do whatever (Obama) tells him -- if Boehner had said I am not coming unless you speak to me in a respectful way, I am third in line to the president, (then I won’t come). ""Ronald Reagan would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on — that's how much he revered the presidency. This guy (Obama) worked like hell to be president, okay? He’s got it. Behave like a president."" Langone’s comment is heavily opinionated, and at PolitiFact we make it our policy not to fact-check opinions. However, Langone used a vivid example that we think is checkable -- namely, whether it’s true that Reagan ""would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on."" As we look into that question, we’ll compare Reagan’s sartorial habits in the Oval Office with Obama’s to see whether Langone is justified in using Obama’s clothing choices to support his view that Obama is ""not acting presidential."" We began by contacting people who either worked in the Reagan White House or who covered it as journalists. Annelise Anderson said that neither she nor her husband Martin, both of whom worked in the Reagan White House, ""ever saw Reagan in the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room without a tie and jacket"" and that they’d frequently heard that Reagan didn't even take his jacket off in the heat of summer. ""Martin was in meetings with Reagan several times a day while he was assistant to the president for policy development,"" she said. ""I was associate director of the Office of Management and Budget and saw the president less often, but always with coat and tie. Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter, was far more casual."" Andrea Mitchell, who covered the Reagan White House for NBC News and who now hosts MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports, said she agrees that ""Reagan was more formal than some of his predecessors or successors. My recollection is that Reagan did usually wear his jacket in the Oval Office, as did many other presidents, at least when they were photographed. But there were clearly informal moments, especially on weekends and holidays when they didn’t have outside visitors."" For documentary evidence, we turned to the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif. We reached Steve Branch, an audiovisual archivist with the National Archives and Records Administration, who may know more than anyone else about the official White House photographs of the Reagan era. ""We do have photos of President Reagan in the Oval Office without a coat and tie, but these only appear to be on weekends and I believe only for his Saturday radio addresses,"" Branch said. ""During the regular work week, he always wore a coat and tie, which is evident from all the photos we have in our collection."" As an example, Branch forwarded us contact sheets from two rolls of film that show Reagan in casual dress. Both were taken when Reagan came in to make a Saturday radio address. We found an additional image of a casual Reagan in the Oval Office in this slide show compiled by the Huffington Post. Mark Weinberg, an assistant press secretary in the Reagan White House, offered a simple explanation for why Reagan decided not to wear a jacket on weekends. ""He did not want to make everyone coming into work feel like they had to dress up too,"" Weinberg said. ""He knew that if he wore one, everyone else would, and he felt it was not fair to younger staff coming into work on weekends."" So Langone is incorrect when he says that Reagan would ""never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on."" There’s photographic evidence showing Reagan jacket-less in the Oval Office, but there’s also ample evidence that Reagan usually wore jackets during the work week. What about Langone’s conclusion that Reagan’s dress habits in the White House stemmed from ""how much he revered the presidency""? We heard, particularly from former Reagan aides, that the 40th president treated the office with reverence. ""He made a point of saying the Oval Office was not his, that it belonged to the people, and he was only the custodian,"" Weinberg said. ""I never, ever heard him refer to it as ‘my office.’"" However, other experts see additional explanations for Reagan’s formality. One issue is the image-making that has shaped the modern presidency. Reagan, who polished his skills as an actor in Hollywood, has been widely hailed as a modern master of image-making. When Reagan was at his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., he tended to wear western garb. In Washington, he tended to dress more formally. Both styles complemented and reinforced each other, helping define a clear persona of someone who was robust and in charge. ""Reagan understood that the image one projects helps shape the public’s view, and I suspect it is not just generational that a president who carries himself in a more formal, dignified manner projects by that a bit more gravitas than a president who dresses and acts like he’s just ‘one of the guys,’"" said Sam Donaldson, who covered the Reagan White House for ABC News. To the extent that Obama has sometimes appeared without a jacket for Oval Office meetings, his decision communicates something different, said Bronwyn Cosgrave, the author of Sample: Cuttings from Contemporary Fashion and Costume & Fashion: A Complete History. Cosgrave said Obama in shirtsleeves ""projects the sense that he is actually rolling up his sleeves, getting down to business and tackling the task of running the country,"" The other factor has to do with the norms for a man of Reagan’s generation. Lou Cannon, an author and journalist who covered Reagan both as California governor and as president, told PolitiFact that ""Reagan certainly did revere the office of the presidency, but, in my view, the fact he wore a coat and tie to work is mostly generational. He did the same in Sacramento, at least on weekdays, when he was governor. People of my father's generation -- he was born seven years before Reagan -- were taught to wear a suit and tie for formal occasions and certainly would have done so in the White House."" Fashion historians agreed that it’s important to keep in mind generational shifts. ""The norms for dress have changed since the Reagan years to a much more casual attire,"" said Joanne B. Eicher, editor in chief of the Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion and an emeritus professor of design, housing, and apparel at the University of Minnesota. ""This can even be seen in what people wear for air travel, as one example, then and now."" Eicher said that ""many men today do not wear complete suits or even jackets with trousers to social functions as once was expected. For example, a prominent business executive I know, about 60, was attending a late afternoon wedding reception last month wearing a well-pressed long-sleeved plaid shirt, with no tie. Times have changed a lot in regard to what is acceptable."" We also tried to judge how often Obama has gone jacket-less in the Oval Office. We did this by looking at the White House Flickr stream, which includes photographs taken by the official White House photographers. We found that in the great majority of Oval Office photographs during his presidency, Obama was seen wearing a suit. We did find that Obama was likelier to be jacket-less during his first 100 days in office, with 13 instances during that period. However, in the 26 months since then, Obama has sharply curtailed the number of times he has been caught on camera in the Oval Office without a jacket. We found only eight examples on weekdays during that period, or about one such occasion every three months. (We found two additional cases after the first 100 days when Obama went casual on a weekend or holiday.) We also noted that none of these eight occasions included an outsider. All showed Obama either by himself or with top aides or cabinet members. Eicher, the fashion historian, added that even when jacket-less, Obama's choice of shirts and ties is ""immaculate."" Most people who we interviewed for this story thought Langone had gone too far in demonizing Obama. ""Reagan was a transformational president, but I don't really think the fact he wore a coat and tie to the Oval Office had anything to do with it,"" said Cannon, the Reagan biographer. ""And while I have my criticisms of President Obama, the notion that ‘his behavior’ means ‘the end of America as we know it’ is rot. Obama dresses appropriately for the present generation, as Reagan did for his."" Bruce Bartlett, an economist who worked in the Reagan White House, agreed that ""Reagan was certainly more formal than Carter, but probably no more so than Nixon or Ford had been. I don’t have the impression that Obama is any different than most presidents in that regard. In any case, it is idiotic to say that he would be debasing the presidency by not wearing a jacket."" So where does this leave us? Langone isn’t correct that Reagan ""would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on,"" since he did dress casually on weekend days. But it is true that Reagan consistently wore a jacket on weekdays. That’s a stricter standard than Obama has set, though the differences between the two presidents aren’t as divergent as Langone suggests. In addition, most people we interviewed thought that he went too far when he used Obama’s patterns of dress as evidence that he is ""unpresidential."" Since the end of Obama’s first 100 days, Obama has been photographed without a jacket in the Oval Office only about once every three months and never with a visitor who wasn’t a senior staff member or appointee. The vast majority of photographs show Obama dressed in a jacket in the Oval Office, even though fashion experts agreed that generational norms have shifted, making jackets less essential, and less expected, in such settings. It's clear that Reagan's customary dress -- relaxed only on weekends -- was a suit and tie. But Langone's use of the word ""never"" overstated the case. In our rulings, words matter. So we rate Langone’s statement Mostly False.",None,Ken Langone,None,None,None,2011-08-01T16:48:03,2011-07-28,"['Ronald_Reagan', 'Barack_Obama', 'Oval_Office']"
190,pomt-11076,"Says Sen. Tim Kaine ""approves of and even applauds his son's participation in a known terrorist organization, #Antifa.""",mostly false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/20/corey-stewart/corey-stewarts-comments-sen-tim-kaine-and-antifa/,"Corey Stewart, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Virginia, promised a ruthless campaign against incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine. A day after securing his party’s nomination, he tweeted one of his first attacks. ""Virginia's sitting senator approves of and even applauds his son's participation in a known terrorist organization, #Antifa,"" Stewart wrote June 13, 2018. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Kaine’s son, Linwood Michael ""Woody"" Kaine, has indeed attended protests affiliated with Antifa, a far-left collection of autonomous anti-fascist groups that are spread throughout the country and share several causes, including the resistance of white supremacist movements. Because Antifa is an umbrella term for many different groups, it does not have an official website or membership. When asked for evidence to support the tweet, Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch pointed to an article in The Federalist, a conservative website, about Woody Kaine’s arrest for counter-protesting at a pro-Donald Trump rally held in the state Capitol in Minnesota on March 4, 2017. According to local reports, Woody Kaine was one of six counter-protesters arrested by St. Paul Police. He was part of a group of approximately 100 counter-protestors, some of whom set off smoke bombs and fireworks inside the building. Witnesses reported seeing Antifa flags in the crowd of counter-protestors. Though peaceful during the rally, police said the younger Kaine tried to run when approached by an officer and that he had to be restrained. A judge sentenced him to a year of probation and ordered him to pay $236 in fines and fees for resisting arrest. Other counter-protestors were charged with felonies for using tear gas. ""While some were charged for disruptive activity at the rally, Woody behaved peacefully there and faced no such charges,"" said Kaine spokeswoman Miryam Lipper after the sentencing. ""He has pled guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with actions during an arrest after leaving the rally."" Fritsch said another statement issued jointly by the senator and his wife shortly after the arrest showed that Kaine approves of his son’s Antifa participation. ""We love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues,"" the couple said via a spokesperson. ""They fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully."" But elsewhere, Kaine has been more forceful in his condemnation of non-peaceful protests. In a Sept. 8, 2017, letter sent to constituents inquiring about Antifa, Kaine wrote, ""I condemn all violence at any political demonstration, including any violent activities by members of Antifa."" (We obtained a copy of the letter from Ian Sams, communications director for Kaine’s re-election campaign). ""I have spent my whole life fighting for people and causes I care about, but always peacefully,"" Kaine said. ""Whether in the form of civil discourse or peaceful protest, Americans should continue to have frank discussions with each other and with their leaders."" Sams noted that Kaine also expressed his preference for civil discourse in an op-ed published to CNN. ""We must always balance that popular activism with a requirement to be peaceful — violence has no place in civic discussion,"" he wrote. ""We cannot tolerate violence by anyone, of any political viewpoint, if we truly embrace the principles expressed in the Constitution."" ""Peacefully protesting at a rally does not equate to being a member of Antifa,"" Sams said. For the record, characterizations differ as to whether Antifa qualifies as ""a known terrorist organization."" According to a 2017 Politico report, the Department of Homeland Security formally classified Antifa activities as ""domestic terrorist violence"" in 2016. The Southern Poverty Law Center, by contrast, does not recognize Antifa as a hate group because ""antifa groups do not promote hatred based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity,"" even if it does display a ""propensity for violence."" It is also worth noting that the image Stewart quote-tweeted was doctored to show Kaine presenting before Congress with a poster board of his son’s face. (A hammer and sickle is plastered in the top corner.) In the real photo, Kaine was presenting beside a poster-sized image of a Trump tweet. Sams noted that this is not the first misleading image Stewart has shared in support of the same claim. In August 2017, Stewart tweeted a photo of Antifa — and said Kaine’s son was pictured — that had previously appeared in a Swedish blog more than a year before the Minnesota rally. This was also not Stewart's first misleading tweet related to Kaine's son. In May 2018, for example, he tweeted that Woody Kaine ""attacked elderly people entering a Trump rally."" Our ruling Kaine has encouraged his son and others to peacefully express their political views. But Stewart’s statement that Kaine ""approves of and even applauds his son’s participation in a known terrorist organization"" implied that Kaine has indicated he would be okay with his son’s participation in the violence at Antifa protests, as well. Kaine’s statements tell a different story — namely, that he approves of his son’s Antifa-related protests only when they are peaceful. Kaine has more than once advocated for peaceful protest, and he has also condemned the violence that has driven some to label Antifa as a terrorist group. We rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False.

191,pomt-05249,Says the Affordable Care Act was a federal takeover of the student loan industry and ‘profits’ on the loans go to help pay for the health care law.,mostly false,/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/01/kelly-ayotte/kelly-ayotte-claims-student-loan-change-government/,"College loans and universal health care might not seem to be related, but U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, says there is an unusual linkage. Ayotte tied the two issues together last month in a May 8, 2012, email that her office sent to the press titled, ""We Can Prevent a Student Loan Rate Increase Without Raising Taxes."" The message, meant to convey Ayotte’s stance on temporarily extending existing rates on new subsidized Stafford loans, raised some questions about where student loan interest is going, and whether government ""profits"" from those loans are used to help pay for the health care law. ""Under the Affordable Care Act, which amounted to a federal takeover of the student loan industry, the government borrows money at 2.8 percent and then loans money to students at 6.8 percent. Government profits are then used to help pay for the health care law,"" Ayotte asserted. PolitiFact Ohio has already laid out how the federal government is using student loans to pay for some health care reforms when it fact-checked a claim made by Sen. Rob Portman. Through the Reconciliation Act of 2012, which combined student loans and health care in one bill, Congress removed the private sector from the student loan process, to eliminate federal payments to banks and to move the revenue from the lending process into federal coffers. The savings was expected to be about $58 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, with $39 billion going back into student loan programs, $10 billion toward deficit reduction and $9 billion directed toward health care. Yet, Ayotte’s email took Portman’s logic a step further, claiming a government takeover of the student loan industry and using profits to pay for Obamacare. PolitiFact has given plenty of Pants on Fire ratings to claims that say Obama’s health care law is a federal takeover of the health care system -- it was PolitiFact's Lie of the Year for 2010. But a takeover of the student loan industry? That’s a new one. First we contacted Ayotte’s legislative office to get sources for the claim. They cited PolitiFact Ohio’s Half True ruling on Portman’s claim as back up for Ayotte’s statement. But that only dealt with a portion of what Ayotte was saying. PolitiFact Ohio walked through the history of government involvement with student loans, up to the Reconciliation Act of 2010, which permanently moved the government away from subsidizing private lenders for student loans as had been the practice since 1965. With the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, created with the Higher Education Act of 1965, the federal government guaranteed student loans against default by promising a certain interest rate to the banks, even if the rates students paid were lower. In other words, the government money has always been behind the loans to American students. ""(The Reconciliation Act of 2010) didn’t take over the student loan industry, it ended a federal program,"" said Jason Delisle, Director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation. ""The semantic problem of the government taking over its own program is really kind of crazy."" ""You wouldn’t talk about the government taking over the Social Security program, or a government takeover of Medicare,"" Delisle said. ""It didn’t take over the industry. The private companies that were involved were participating in a federal program and were getting paid for that. So how do you get ‘federal takeover’ out of that?"" Through the FFEL program, the government paid additional fees to banks for administration and collection of student loans, providing them a revenue stream. While millions of Americans earned college degrees, the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies, and some in Washington, especially Democrats, sought alternatives, which ultimately prompted The Reconciliation Act of 2010. When we asked Ayotte’s office to address the ""federal takeover"" of student loans, they pointed to the CBO break down of the Reconciliation Act that explains the reconciliation package would eliminate the federal guaranteed loan program and replace it with direct loans administered by the Department of Education and funded through the U.S. Treasury. Because the government has always backstopped student loans, calling the Reconciliation Act of 2010 a ""federal takeover"" isn’t accurate, said Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor, which is chaired by Democrat Tom Harkin. ""What the health care reconciliation package did was eliminate the middleman,"" Sessions said. ""The middleman equals a bunch of private banks."" In addition, many of the same companies involved in the guaranteed loan program service the expanded direct loan program, Delisle added. They include nonprofit and for-profit companies, including Sallie Mae, Nel Net, Mohela, Granite State Management and Resources, among others. ""The federal government can’t do all this work itself,"" Delisle said. ""(The guaranteed loan program) wasn’t really a private sector thing. What’s really important to understand about that is the government set all of the terms on the loans, the interest rates, the terms of repayment, all of that was set in law and the loan companies couldn’t change those."" And private lenders can still make loans to students, Delisle added. ""They can do it, they just don’t get any subsidies from the government,"" Delisle said. ""They don’t do it because it’s a money loser."" As for the rates Ayotte’s staff provided, those were accurate, Delisle said, but to call the interest the government gains on the loans ""profits,"" is a stretch. ""Banks can borrow at the same rate as the federal government,"" Delisle said. ""They don’t make money off lending to students at 6.8 percent. … This concept that the difference between the rate the government charges on the loan and the rate they pay to borrow is profit, is totally wrong."" Subsidized loans do not make money for the government, Sessions said. They actually cost the federal government money. ""The claim seems to conflate two completely unrelated issues,"" Sessions said. ""The 6.8 percent interest rate was set by Congress in 2002 with overwhelming bipartisan support and it was the projected average rate that would result in 2006 under a fixed rate formula."" Loans had the same interest rates under both the direct loan and FFEL programs, Sessions said, and the cost of student loans to the government fluctuates with program changes, economic conditions, borrower repayment patterns, and the relationship between the government’s borrowing rate and the interest rate at which borrowers repay loans. There’s also more to the cost of the loan than what the government pays to borrow, Delisle added, including losses from defaults, administrative costs, cost of equity, loan forgiveness, and risk. Current fixed rates do not offset those additional costs. ""The bottom line is that the claim about the 2010 legislation that cut out the middleman in the student loan system is completely unrelated to the claim about what government charges for student loans,"" Sessions said. ""Reinstating the FFEL program would cost the government additional fees and subsidies that would be paid to banks."" Our ruling The government’s Reconciliation Act of 2010 was not a takeover, but rather an elimination of a federal student loan program the government had used since 1965. Private companies are still involved in servicing the program and private lenders can still make their own student loans without a government subsidy. The government does borrow in the 2.8 percent ballpark and loans money to students at 6.8 percent but the difference is not a profit, it helps compensate for the unanticipated losses inherent with any loan. Finally, the money saved in the Reconciliation Act of 2010, not ""profits"" from the direct loans, is used to fund elements of the Affordable Care Act. Since Ayotte’s statements have elements of truth but lack critical facts, we give her a Mostly False. UPDATE: This item has been updated to note that Justine Sessions is a spokeswoman for the Democrat-controlled Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor. Also, we have corrected a quotation from Jason Delisle who said he mistakenly said the government does not ""make money off lending to students at 2.8 percent,"" when he meant to say 6.8.",None,Kelly Ayotte,None,None,None,2012-06-01T13:44:53,2012-05-08,['None']
192,pomt-08713,"Ron Johnson is ""willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies.""",mostly false,/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/03/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-ron-johnson-willing-hand-over-g/,"As in the Gulf of Mexico, oil just won’t disappear from the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin. It’s a central part of an ad by U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat locked in a tough re-election battle. Not only does the ad argue that Republican Ron Johnson wants to drill for oil in the Great Lakes, it says he’s ""willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies."" For lake-loving Wisconsinites, the issue hits home. The charge goes back to a statement that bubbled up when Johnson sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Wispolitics.com. Johnson, an Oshkosh businessman, was asked this question: ""Would you support more drilling in the U.S., continental, Great Lakes for example, if there was oil found there, and more exploration in Alaska, those kind of things?"" Johnson’s answer: ""The bottom line is, we are an oil based economy and there’s nothing we’re going to do to get off of that for many, many years. So we have to be realistic and recognize that fact. We have to get the oil where it is, but we need to do it responsibly, we need to utilize American ingenuity and American technology to make sure we to do it environmentally sensitively and safely."" That’s where it began. This is where it wound up: The Feingold campaign issued a news release June 18 that said, ""when asked if he would support drilling in the Great Lakes, Johnson said: ‘I think we have to get the oil where it is.’ "" The release prompted some chatter in the blogosphere, though the issue remained low on the public radar screen. And the Johnson campaign remained silent. Then came Feingold’s TV ad. It showed a map of the United States and graphically transplanted the BP oil spill from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Michigan shores. Meanwhile, Feingold is heard saying Johnson is ""willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies, threatening Wisconsin’s economy and a way of life for generations of Wisconsin families."" To hear Feingold, one would think BP was ready to plop an oil rig just off the Summerfest grounds. So, we figured it was time for us to do a little drilling of our own to see if Feingold hit the mark. There is little doubt Johnson, a BP shareholder, has a ""Drill, baby, drill"" attitude. On Oct. 10, 2009 -- before he was a candidate -- Johnson told a tea party gathering in Oshkosh: ""I want oil companies to make enough money to continue to explore, drill, refine, and deliver gas to virtually every corner of America."" That would presumably include the Great Lakes. But Johnson’s campaign issued a statement July 12, four weeks after the Wispolitics.com interview, that left no wiggle room. It said: ""I would reject any and all efforts to drill in the Great Lakes."" That statement was issued at 3:49 p.m., the day before the Feingold ad was launched. John Kraus, senior strategist for Feingold’s campaign, said the Johnson statement was issued about an hour after the Feingold campaign made its TV buy. Coincidence, or was Johnson tipped off about the Feingold ad? You decide. Johnson quickly launched his own response ad, which said in part: ""Ron Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes and Russ Feingold knows it."" And Johnson and his campaign later argued there’s not enough oil in the lake to make drilling worthwhile and that it was too cold to do much drilling here anyway. Finally, six weeks after his initial response Johnson said he may have not heard ""Great Lakes"" included in the question. In other words, it’s kind of a gooey mess. Let’s clean it all up. Feingold took an off-the-cuff statement by Johnson -- albeit one Johnson had a month to correct -- and made it the centerpiece of a TV ad that launched the day after Johnson had re-framed his views. Johnson has noted his support for more oil exploration. But the ad made a flat hand-the-lakes-over statement, ignoring Johnson’s expressed concerns for the environment. That’s not handing the lakes over to Big Oil. It was produced based on the original Johnson statement, but the ad remained on the air long after Johnson clearly said no to Great Lakes drilling. And Feingold is continuing to state on the campaign trail: ""It’s kind of reasonable to think that if (Johnson) had a chance to vote for drilling the Great Lakes, he’d be first in line.""

It’s from the conservative organization American Future Fund. Here’s the script: Obama: ""I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street."" Narrator: ""But guess who gave $42 million to Obama’s last campaign for president: Wall Street bankers and financial insiders, more than any other candidate in history. But Obama voted for the Wall Street bailout. His White House is full of Wall Street executives … ."" (The ad then shows photos and lists the names in the White House ""inner circle."") The narrator continues: ""Now, Obama’s flush with cash, returning to Wall Street for even more money. Obama won’t admit to supporting Wall Street, but Wall Street sure supports President Obama."" There are a lot of claims in that ad, and our friends at FactCheck.org have already picked apart the list of 27 officials the ad shows, and whether they really are White House inner circle folks and former Wall Street executives. Many of them aren’t. (FactCheck also wrote that the fund later tweaked the ad.) For our fact-check, we will focus on whether ""Wall Street sure supports Obama."" The ad’s message is that the president is Wall Street’s favored candidate, and that he is cleaning up in Wall Street donations this cycle, just like he did in 2008. The ad was launched in February, but we've seen it on television in Florida in May. A February press release from the fund stated the $4 million buy covered nine states, including Florida, Ohio and Virginia. We contacted the fund to ask if it had any additional citations beyond what was in the ad and did not get a response. First, some background about the American Future Fund: It states on its website that it advocates ""conservative, free market ideals,"" and its president is an Iowa state senator. Many of the group’s ads target Obama. The New York Times reported that the group was started with seed money from an ethanol executive. The Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign donations, wrote in 2010 that the American Future Fund received about half of its $23 million from the Center to Protect Patients Rights, a group that gave donations to groups opposed to the federal health care law or abortion. Obama’s vote as a senator and the 2008 campaign The ad is correct when it states that while a senator Obama voted in favor of the Wall Street bailout (H.R. 1424) on Oct. 1, 2008. He was one of 74 senators, along with his Republican presidential opponent John McCain, to vote in favor. The ad then cites fundraising data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group which analyzes campaign donations. We looked at CRP’s data ourselves for the 2008 and 2012 presidential races. During the 2008 campaign, Obama raised about $42.8 million from the finance/insurance/real estate industry -- far above McCain’s haul of about $31.1 million. (FactCheck.org wrote that Obama’s haul was more than George W. Bush’s in 2004 even when adjusted for inflation.) The center breaks down that finance/insurance/real estate industry into more detail, including securities and investment, which outreach coordinator Evan Mackinder said would be the most specific way to characterize Wall Street donations. Obama raised about $16 million from the securities and investment industry, while McCain raised about $9.4 million. The ad cites the $42 million figure -- the larger and broader number -- rather than the more specific securities and investment number, but the ad can take some leeway on that point, because it described it as ""Wall Street and financial insiders."" After Obama became president and pushed for financial reform, his relationship with some in the finance sector soured. We found many news reports documenting that tension. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, founded the investment firm Bain Capital and has had friendly relations with Wall Street and secured millions from those donors. Romney said he would repeal the Dodd-Frank regulations and has been vague about other reforms that he would enact to avoid the 2008 financial meltdown. Obama and Romney donations in the 2012 race Through April, Romney is in the lead in donations from finance/insurance/real estate and, within that, the securities and investment industry, according to a May analysis written by the Center for Responsive Politics. Romney has raised about $19.2 million from the finance/insurance/real estate including about $8.5 million from the securities and investment industry, according to the center’s analysis. Obama has raised about $8.4 million in the finance/insurance/real estate, including about $3 million from securities and investment. That means Romney has raised between double and triple Obama’s haul from the securities and investment sector. If we look at the donations proportionally, it would show that the securities sector funded about 3 percent of Obama’s haul and 10 percent of Romney’s. (This doesn’t provide a full picture since the center’s analysis is for donations that were more than $200 a pop -- in the case of Obama that means about $99 million of his $217 million is reflected in the analysis by industry.) The analysis shows that the securities/investment industry is the second-largest source of donations for Romney, behind the ""retired"" category. It comes in fifth for Obama, behind retired, lawyers, education and business services. The securities/investment donations are even more lopsided for the super PACs: the Restore Our Future pro-Romney PAC raised about about $21 million from that industry while the Priorities USA Action pro-Obama PAC raised about $218,500. The center wrote in a March blog post that the ad uses its data to make a misleading point when it states that ""Wall Street sure supports President Obama"": In a separate March 2012 article, the center stated that between his campaign committee and a PAC, Romney had received about 72 percent of the near $33 million in Wall Street donations through February. ""The sheer amount of cash Wall Street has sent Romney represents an extremely lopsided giving pattern. No other presidential candidate, including President Barack Obama, comes close to tapping the motherlode of industry riches. The industry's abandonment of Obama could hardly be more dramatic: Wall Street's preferred candidate in the 2008 race with more than $6 million in industry campaign contributions at this point in the cycle, he has received less than $2.6 million from the industry so far this time around."" News articles cited in ad The American Future Fund ad flashes headlines or information from a few news articles. But we found the ad cherry-picked a few of its sources. • The ad shows a partial headline from an October 2011 Washington Post story: ""Obama still flush with cash from financial sector."" The rest of that headline, which was omitted from the ad, stated, ""despite frosty relations."" The article explains that Obama had raised more from the financial and banking sector than Romney but not when putting aside Democratic National Committee money. • The ad cites the headline from a February 2012 Bloomberg article ""Obama returns to NYC for Wall Street fundraiser."" That article includes this sentence: ""So far this election cycle, he hasn’t been able to match the success he had four years ago in getting money from Wall Street."" Our ruling The American Future Fund’s ad says, ""Obama’s flush with cash, returning to Wall Street for even more money. … Wall Street sure supports President Obama."" It is true that Obama has received millions of dollars from Wall Street this cycle. But the intention of the ad is to suggest that Obama is Wall Street’s preferred candidate, just like in 2008. In reality, the numbers don’t bare that out -- Romney is the preferred candidate, based on both campaign contributions and news coverage. The fund’s ad relies on data from Center for Responsive Politics, but it uses the data in a misleading way. Whether we looked at the broader finance/insurance/real estate industry or the more narrow securities and investment sector, the Romney campaign is far ahead of the Obama campaign in dollars.

That's illegal.""",mostly false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/19/hillary-clinton/if-shes-right-bills-a-criminal/,"During a campaign stop at a supermarket in Des Moines, Iowa, Hillary Clinton was asked by a shopper to autograph a dollar bill. She refused. ""I can't sign money. That's illegal,"" Clinton said, according to a CBS News video of the exchange. ""I'm so sorry."" The shopper then showed reporters the dollar, which had apparently been autographed by Clinton's husband. ""Well,"" the shopper said, ""Bill signed it."" So let's explore whether Sen. Clinton is correct, which would implicate her husband in a federal crime. In fact, the Treasury Department says ""defacement of currency"" is against the law. The law specifies that ""whoever mutilates, cuts, disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued, shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both."" But if Bill is busted for violating Title 18, Section 333, then the feds will also have to prosecute some other prominent law-breakers, including treasury secretaries who have routinely autographed dollar bills, which are printed with their signatures. Like so many laws, this one becomes a matter of interpretation. In this case, it's a question of whether an autograph is a deliberate attempt to deface a bill so it can't be used again. The Treasury Department doesn't think so and says autographing dollar bills is permitted. A department fact sheet says, ""Throughout the years, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States have autographed currency notes bearing their signatures at the request of private citizens. This practice is not considered as defacement since the autographs are generally provided to persons as keepsakes as opposed to circulating currency."" Claudia Dickens, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, said it only becomes a violation when it is mutilated so much that it is"" unacceptable to a merchant or vending machine. That's defacing."" She said autographing ""is certainly not something that the Department of Treasury encourages, but it's not disallowed."" And so we find that although Clinton's statement has a germ of truth because defacing dollars is illegal, she is wrong about an innocent autograph.

""People disagree about this, but the estate tax, which came into being by Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and others, and has been part of our tax system for a very long time, is there for a real simple reason: In America, we've never liked the idea of massive inherited wealth,"" she said during a town hall forum in Derry. ""Part of the reason why America has always remained a meritocracy where you have to work for what you get ... is that we never had a class of people sitting on generation after generation after generation of huge inherited wealth."" Clinton's historical account, and dig at Republicans, shows selective memory. Estate taxes — a tax on the property passed forward and received at death — were first levied in 1797 under President John Adams, a Federalist. In that case, the revenue went to cover the cost of raising a Navy. The two subsequent times it was enacted, in 1862 and 1898, it paid for military conflicts (first the Civil War and then the Spanish-American War), before being repealed again. Clinton is correct that Republican Theodore Roosevelt advocated renewing the estate tax. On Dec. 4, 1906, he told Congress, ""The man of great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to the State, because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government."" But Roosevelt left office before it became law in 1916 — under President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, who used the tax to help pay for World War I. Another Democrat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, raised rates twice, in 1934 and 1935, to help fund federal programs during the Great Depression. At that time, he said, ""The transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes by will, inheritance, or gift is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the American people."" Since then, the estate tax has continued to increase as have the number and size of the exemptions. Under tax cuts passed by President Bush, it is being phased out by 2010. Clinton wants to abolish the tax cuts she said only help the wealthy and use the estate tax to fund a new retirement system.

""We’ve gone from paying about $100 for EpiPens to over $600. And they only hold about one dollar’s worth of medicine,"" the Aug. 29, 2017, video says. ""We don’t have a choice but to pay it and the drug companies know it. Vote yes on Issue 2, the Drug Price Relief Act."" Do EpiPens really cost that much, and could their price go down with an up-vote on the ballot initiative? Prescription drugs may be severely overpriced, but the ad misrepresents the bill’s impact. And strangely, its example of EpiPens doesn’t really apply to the population that the group is trying to help. Issue 2 is a ballot initiative up for a vote on Nov. 7. If approved, it would require all drugs bought by the state -- whether for Medicaid or other state programs -- to match Veterans Affairs prices, which receive a 24 percent discount off market price in addition to sometimes undisclosed rebates. The idea is that it would lower the state’s health care costs. The ad has a point that the price for the EpiPen two-pack soared since 2007, from $94 to $609. Each pen holds about one dollar’s worth of the drug epinephrine. While the ad makes it sound as though there is no alternative, Mylan released a $300 generic EpiPen two-pack in December 2016 and Lineage Therapeutics offers a generic auto-injector for $110. That’s still a lot, but it’s less than the $600 the ad mentions. The ad also misrepresents the population the initiative would aid, as approximately 70 percent of EpiPen users are privately insured, and Medicaid patients already pay nothing out of pocket, according to Brittany Warner, an Ohio Medicaid spokeswoman. And even if the ad was referring to the prices paid by the state, instead of patients, Medicaid already enjoys significant discounts. Brand EpiPen 2-pak’s listed price for the Medicaid program is $291.41, but because it doesn’t include rebates (which remain confidential), it may be lower. The VA price is indeed lower: $182.33, which includes rebates. ""They’re trying to appeal to the sense of outrage of high drug prices, especially for things that ought to be covered for free, but it’s a weird example to cite in the context of this particular initiative, as the vast majority of people who use it are privately insured,"" said Kao-Ping Chua, a health policy researcher at the University of Chicago who co-authored a study of out-of-pocket spending on EpiPens. Chua said the privately insured and the uninsured bore the greatest brunt of the price increase, though the price they faced for the injectors varied depending on the type of plan they are on. According to Julie Knell, a spokeswoman for Mylan, the company that sells EpiPens, ""nearly 90 percent of consumers who received EpiPen Auto-Injector or its authorized generic had an out-of-pocket cost of less than $100 and more than 80 percent are paying less than $50."" ""I would still argue that $100 is a lot to pay for a life-saving medication,"" Chua said. ""This is the difference between life and death."" In addition to the Medicaid program, the state purchases drugs for state employees, prisons, and other state-run programs, but the campaign was unable to pin down the effect of the initiative on these groups. Dennis Willard, a campaign spokesman, said 4 million Ohioans would be affected, 2.8 million of whom are on Medicaid or CHIP. Rachel Sachs, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, told us that if the initiative worked (she identified various legal issues with it in a blog post), the biggest impact would be felt by state correctional systems, which go unmentioned in the ad. Chua warned that if lowering the price for the privately insured was the goal of Issue 2, this wasn’t the best way forward, as companies could raise costs for private insurers to make up for lost revenue from states like Ohio. Opposition ads make a similar argument, claiming VA prices could also increase in response to the act. Researchers Thomas J. Hwang and Aaron S. Kesselheim evaluated this question when the group proposed a similar initiative in California. (It didn’t pass.) They said that the long-term budgetary effect of the ballot initiative was uncertain. A review claiming causation between a similar 1990 measure and increased VA prices couldn’t be ""credibly established,"" they said. Sachs said that restricting the price pharmaceutical companies can demand from the state of Ohio shouldn’t affect the price they offer private insurers or the VA. That’s because price discrimination makes it so that pharmaceuticals arrange different prices with each market, and there’s no reason to believe they haven’t already struck the best deal possible in each one. While studies suggest cost-shifting, or the displacement of costs on other markets, has little impact on hospitals, Sachs admits there’s insufficient research on this phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry. In the absence of research on the impact of similar initiatives elsewhere, Gerard Anderson, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it would be difficult to gauge the proposal’s impact on the privately insured. Our ruling A pro-Issue 2 ad in Ohio claimed, ""We’ve gone from paying about $100 for Epipens to over $600. And they only hold about one dollar’s worth of medicine. We don’t have a choice but to pay it and the drug companies know it."" There is a key difference in the ""we"" paying $600 -- a relatively small fraction of the privately insured population -- and the population for whom the initiative plans to lower prices. The majority of those covered by state-sponsored insurance, like Medicaid, already pay a $0 co-pay. The campaign didn’t provide evidence of the impact on other state-insured populations, though it could have a significant impact on the smaller prison population, which does not face the same rebates as the Medicaid program. The ballot initiative would have no formal effect on prices for the privately insured, and the trickle-down effect for market prices remains speculative. We rate this claim Mostly False.

197,pomt-02929,"Ken Cuccinelli would ""take money away from public schools to fund private schools.""",mostly false,/virginia/statements/2013/nov/01/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-would-use-public-school-/,"Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe says Ken Cuccinelli, his Republican rival, is no friend to public education. ""On education, he’d take money away from public schools to fund private schools,"" the McAuliffe campaign says in a TV ad that began airing Oct. 16. The claim -- according to Josh Schwerin, a McAuliffe spokesman -- centers on Cuccinelli’s plan to empower parents whose children attend what the state deems to be a failing school. Under the proposal, a majority of parents could vote to change the leadership of such a school, close it, transform it to a charter school, or put their children in their choice of public or private schools. Cuccinelli would have the state compensate parents for additional costs they incurred by changing their child’s school. He would establish a scholarship fund for children who switched public schools. And he would seek legislation allowing Virginia to provide the parents with tax credits to defray tuition at nonsectarian, private schools. Cuccinelli also wants to offer the tax credits to failing-school parents who want to send their children to religious academies. This would require voters to approve what he called a ""narrowly drafted"" amendment to the state constitution, which bans state aid for K-12 sectarian education. Cuccinelli has not put a pricetag on the tax break. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said the total cost would vary based on how many parents opt for the tax credit choice and how much it costs to educate a child in those private venues. McAuliffe's ad says the plan would force localities to raise property taxes to compensate for lost state aid to public schools. Seeking a bottom line, we came up with our own estimate of the cost of the tax credit. Cuccinelli would define a failing school as one that was denied state accreditation because of chronically low student achievement. There are six such schools this year: three in Norfolk, two in Petersburg and one in Alexandria. According to state Department of Education figures, total enrollment at those schools was 3,335 last school year. Based on per-pupil allocations to each of the cities housing a failing school, the state spent $16.9 million educating those students. So the maximum cost of the tax credit -- assuming every student at every failing school would up being privately educated -- would be about $16.9 million this year. That’s about three-tenths of 1 percent of the nearly $5.2 billion in general funds the state will spend on public education. Nix said Cuccinelli ""will not touch education"" to pay for the tax credit. But Democrats have long argued that it’s impossible to cut income taxes without affecting the long-term money available to public schools. That’s because income taxes are the largest revenue source for the state’s general fund -- now at $17.4 billion -- which pays for education, health programs and public safety. About 30 percent of the general fund is traditionally allocated for public education. Our ruling McAuliffe says Cuccinelli would ""take away money from public schools to pay for private schools."" Cuccinelli’s K-12 plan opens that possibility by proposing tax credits for the parents of children in failing public schools to defray their cost of switching to private education. The program, if passed by the General Assembly, would have enormous symbolic meaning because it would crack Virginia’s tradition of not directly aiding private schools. McAuliffe’s statement, however, lacks perspective. It doesn’t note that Cuccinelli’s program would be very small. This year, only six of Virginia’s 1,828 public schools are failing. They are attended by 3,335 of the state’s 1.27 million students. In the unlikely scenario that every failing-school parent switched their children to private schools, Cuccinelli’s tax credit would have cost about $16.9 million this year -- one-third of 1 percent of the state’s public education budget. Cuccinelli says he would not cut the K-12 budget to pay for his plan. But in the long run under other governors, the revenues available to fund public education would be reduced -- very marginally -- to support the private school tax break. So there’s a sliver of accuracy to McAuliffe’s statement, but it creates a misleading impression of Cuccinelli’s education platform.

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., that impeachment is in the offing. Waters is confident that the special counsel and the congressional investigations will uncover proof of collusion. ""I really do believe that much of what you saw coming out of Trump's mouth was a play from Putin's playbook,"" Waters said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe May 18. ""I think you can see visits, you know, to Moscow made during the campaign by (Paul) Manafort and others."" Waters went as far as to say that the ""lock her up"" chant aimed at Hillary Clinton was ""developed strategically with people from the Kremlin, with Putin."" While we have reported on the ties of Manafort -- Trump’s former campaign chairman -- to Russian interests, we wondered about Waters’ claim that he and others visited Moscow during the campaign. We found one clear example. There is no public record that Manafort went at all. Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page did go to Moscow in July 2016. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn also went to Moscow, but at a time when he wasn't part of Trump's team. The Center for American Progress, a Democratic policy group, has a webpage it calls the Moscow Project where it compiles information on ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Democratic group lists no travel to Moscow by Manafort. Trump named Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention and by May 2016 elevated him to campaign chairman. Manafort stepped down in mid August. Manafort had dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian operative with reported ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik came to the United States twice during the campaign, but so far as we could tell, Manafort didn’t reciprocate with a trip of his own. The travels of Page provide the clearest support for Waters’ statement. Page founded an investment company with business in Russia. In March 2016, Trump mentioned Page as one of a group of advisers on foreign policy. In July, Page went to Moscow and spoke at a university graduation. After the election, he went to Moscow again. Page called the suggestion that he was a back channel between the campaign and the Russians a ""witch hunt."" The only other publicly known trip to Russia’s capital by a Trump insider was Flynn’s visit in December 2015 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT (Russia Today), a government media operation. Flynn reportedly was paid for giving a speech at the event. According to one account, Flynn went to Trump Tower at some point in the fall of 2015 to advise Trump on the Islamic State and Iran. In February 2016, he was reported to be someone Trump turned to on foreign policy. Flynn said he was advising multiple candidates at the time. It took until June before Flynn was openly praising Trump over Clinton. We reached out to Waters’office and did not hear back. Our ruling Waters said that Manafort and others with ties to the Trump campaign went to Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign. From what’s on the public record, Manafort didn’t go at all, and Page went once. Flynn went after Trump announced, but before there is any report of a strong and exclusive tie to the candidate. The various investigations underway might resolve whether there was collusion, but the travel itineraries of Trump’s associates don’t appear to be fertile ground at this point.

In this one, folksy music plays under a voiceover reminiscent of a Jeep commercial. ""Twenty million Americans are out of work. That’s unacceptable. But John Kasich won’t stop until that number is zero. As governor, Kasich delivered the largest tax cut in the nation, and over 400,000 new jobs have been created through his leadership. As president, Kasich will cut taxes, freeze new regulations and reshore American jobs. So punch the clock. Take that to the bank. America, let’s go to work."" Ohio is among the states that come up in discussions about big tax cuts. But was Kasich’s truly the largest in the nation? ""There are at least half a dozen reasons why there has to be an asterisk after that sentence,"" said Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank. ""The ones that come to mind are Kansas and Ohio, and to a lesser extent, North Carolina, Texas, maybe even Florida,"" said Davis. ""But it’s complicated, because tax changes are often enacted in stages, and in some cases are accompanied by tax hikes, like on cigarettes in Kansas and Ohio. Trying to gauge what the revenue of a state would have been without the tax cuts is really difficult."" Kasich’s spokesman, Rob Nichols, provided us with a table showing a summary of the governor’s net tax reductions from 2012 through 2017. It shows the net total reductions as $4.9 billion, which the campaign rounds up to $5 billion. Yet Kansas, not Ohio, consistently rises to the top of searches for ""largest tax cut."" A fellow with the Show-Me Institute, Andrew Wilson, called Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback’s tax reduction ""the biggest tax cut of any state, relative to the size of its economy, in recent history,"" in a June 2015 article in The Week. (The Show-Me Institute is a right-leaning think tank in Missouri.) Shawn Sullivan, the director of budget and business processes for the state of Kansas, provided data on Brownback’s tax cuts. The Kansas state budget office projects that between 2014, when Brownback’s tax cuts fully went into effect, and 2019, the cumulative tax reduction will be $3.9 billion. At face value, it would seem that Ohio’s tax cuts under Kasich, at $5 billion, are larger. But the major hurdle that makes the numbers difficult to get a handle on, Davis says, is consideration for population differences between states. Kansas and Ohio certainly aren’t apples-to-apples. The 2014 U.S. Census pegged Kansas’ population at 2.9 million. Ohio’s population in 2014 was 11.6 million -- nearly four times more people. Then there are those who argue that Kasich’s tax cuts weren’t really tax cuts. A spokesperson with the Ohio Democratic party, Kirstin Alvanitakis, told us, ""We would argue very strongly that Kasich’s tax cut was actually more of a tax shift. The state’s cuts to local governments have resulted in local tax hikes."" The president of the Ohio Association of Professional Fire Fighters, Mark Sanders, likewise complained that fire and ambulance services statewide have had to ask voters to step up their local tax levels, as decreased revenue from state income taxes slashed budgets for emergency services between 2011 and 2013. Davis, with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said that by some estimates, Kansas’ tax cuts cost over $1 billion per year. ""If you adjust for population, that would certainly seem to exceed anything enacted in Ohio under Governor Kasich,"" Davis said. Kasich’s not-so-humblebrag about his tax cuts rings even less true considering that it was the Legislature that added in a tax cut larger than what Kasich’s 2015 plan originally proposed, by more than double. ""He did sign them,"" Davis concedes, ""but his original proposal would have been a lot smaller."" Our ruling The Kasich campaign ad says that ""as governor, Kasich delivered the largest tax cut in the nation."" The ad exaggerated in claiming that Ohio's tax cut topped every other state. While Ohio’s cuts are significant, when you factor in state population and economic size, Kansas’ reduction may be larger over time. Ohio’s shifting of the tax burden, from individual income tax to taxation on consumption, is what some consider more of a tax shift than a tax cut, and forces local governments to raise taxes in turn. Plus, the size of the tax cut wasn’t entirely Kasich’s idea, since it was the Legislature that made it bigger than he first proposed.

200,pomt-05152,"Says President Obama's new immigration plan ""is amnesty.""",mostly false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/20/jim-demint/immigration-plan-enforcement-amnesty/,"After President Barack Obama unveiled a new immigration plan for young people who came to the U.S. illegally, it didn't take long for opponents to criticize the plan with a familiar word: amnesty. Sen. Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, responded with a press release that said Obama's action on undocumented youth ""is amnesty."" That was echoed by other Republicans such as U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, who said ""President Obama's decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants is a breach of faith with the American people."" The Obama plan, which does not require congressional approval, allows young people who came here illegally to apply for temporary relief from deportation. In a memo, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano gave immigration officers the leeway to grant that relief for up to two years at a time. They also can approve work permits. Obama said it was the right thing to do for the economy and because ""we are a better nation than one that expels innocent young kids."" He said, ""This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It’s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary, stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people."" In this fact-check, we'll examine whether it is accurate to call the new Obama plan ""amnesty."" DeMint’s spokesman, Wesley Denton, says the matter is straightforward. ""When people who are here unlawfully are told by the government that they will not be prosecuted and instead given a legal status and work permits, that’s amnesty,"" Denton says. In the immigration debate, there is no word more loaded than amnesty. PolitiFact has done many fact-checks on various uses of the word and found it is more accurate when it’s applied to policies that lead to permanent legal status. A tweet from Georgia congressman Paul Broun during the 2011 State of the Union address saying Obama ""is calling for amnesty"" took a rating of Half-True. While it lacked some necessary qualifiers, it referred to the president’s support for the DREAM Act, a bill that offers the possibility of citizenship. It’s helpful to look at the legal definitions of amnesty. Black’s Law Dictionary defines it as ""a sovereign act of pardon and oblivion for past acts, granted by a government to all persons who have been guilty of crime."" The Legal Dictionary at the FreeDictionary.com offers more background and notes that ""an act of amnesty is generally granted to a group of people who have committed crimes against the state."" It gives the example from 1977 when President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty for Vietnam War draft dodgers. Overall, you can break amnesty into two elements, and it’s the second that really matters. It applies to a group of people who have broken the law. And it says to those people, you are permanently free from punishment for your offense. The new Obama policy matches up on the first part but not the second. ""It does not forgive anything, nor does it create any new rights,"" says Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group that is supported by groups such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the World Bank. Chishti emphasizes, ""You are still subject to deportation if the the government decides to do that."" While some have said any relief from legal action is amnesty, whether it lasts for two years or forever, Chishti said the temporary nature of the Obama plan makes it significantly different than true amnesty. Indeed, the legal definitions provide examples where amnesty is permanent immunity from punishment. Chishti’s group estimates that about 1.4 million undocumented residents would be eligible under the new program. How many actually come forward might depend on their assessment of the risks. Ben Johnson, Executive Director of the American Immigration Council, a group that supports the move by Obama, agreed with Chishti's point that the policy offered people only temporary relief. He said anyone applying under the program has to understand that they will be giving immigration officials a lot of personal information. ""Two years from now, they might be more vulnerable"" to deportation, Johnson said. But there's also the practical definition of amnesty. If the ax of deportation never falls, critics of the administration ask, was it ever really there? The Homeland Security memo lays out a program that would grant deportation relief for two years at a time, renewable for as long as the applicant is under 30 years old, after which they would no longer qualify for deferral. During that time, the person could, at local discretion, be granted a work permit. While the White House made much of the temporary nature of the policy, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, isn’t buying it. ""There’s nothing as permanent as a temporary status,"" Krikorian says. He and other opponents of this approach to young illegal immigrants can’t imagine that after encouraging people to come forward and allowing them to work, the government would then turn around and deport them. Still, we find it's a stretch to describe an enforcement plan as amnesty, a legal term that connotes broad and permanent protection. The people who are accepted into Obama's plan might not be deported immediately but they still could be in the future. Our Ruling DeMint and other critics say the Obama plan is amnesty, but the facts of the plan indicate it's an exaggeration to describe it that way. Legally, amnesty focuses on a group of people and grants them a permanent pardon. The Obama administration’s policy could reasonably be said to focus on a group, but deferring deportation is not the same as forgiveness and the relief it offers is limited in time. Concerns about where this policy might lead are a valid topic for discussion, but go beyond what the policy actually says.

201,pomt-03223,"""Only in Washington would politicians spend $27 million to teach Moroccans how to make pottery.""",mostly false,/georgia/statements/2013/aug/21/karen-handel/pottery-class-claim-takes-truth-spin/,"The race to fill retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ seat is in full swing with candidates on both sides of the aisle jockeying for early position among their competitors. A common theme, particularly among the GOP candidates, has been the need to rein in wasteful government spending. Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel has taken this topic to another level. Handel began a daily blog, titled ""Only in Washington,"" detailing alleged wastefulness by the federal government. Handel is planning to chronicle ""42 ridiculous things that happen only in Washington,"" and this week she reached the halfway point. PolitiFact Georgia perused the 20 or so completed entries and found some to be quite interesting. For example, Day 8’s item: ""Only in Washington would politicians spend $27 million to teach Moroccans how to make pottery,"" Handel said. ""While Morocco is no doubt a lovely place, we have families in Georgia that are being hurt by high taxes fueling out of control spending … What’s worse is that the program was deemed a failure …,"" she continued. Almost $30 million for pottery classes in any country sounded outrageous. We decided to dig a little deeper to determine whether these costs were accurate. A press release accompanying each day’s item includes sources that Handel’s team has used to make the statements. For the Day 8 item, the sources included a couple of news stories about the spending that Handel’s spokesman provided. The claim has been repeated by politicos before, including conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly. Earlier this year, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked into this claim as a portion of a three-part statement made by a congressman from that state about government spending. The congressman was found to be incorrect for overstating this portion of his claim about the pottery class spending. Much of the background about this claim originated from a similar aggregation of alleged wasteful federal government spending done by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn. Each year, the Republican senator from Oklahoma releases an oversight report of ""unnecessary, duplicative and low-priority projects spread throughout the federal government"" in a document called the Wastebook. Coburn’s Wastebook 2012 highlights the pottery classes as an example of wasteful spending, but notes that only part of the $27 million of a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) project went toward the classes. In 2009, USAID began a $30 million, four-year plan to help increase the economic competitiveness of Morocco. The plan included five projects, with the Morocco Economic Competitive Project accounting for $27 million, or 90 percent of the overall plan. The Competitive Project, scheduled to run through Sept. 30, 2013, initially included a provision for a $7 million, one-year extension. But because of anticipated budget cuts, a change in mission strategy, complications with the task order and poor implementation of some activities, it is unlikely the project will be extended, according to a December 2011 audit report by a federal inspector general. The initial goals of the project were to improve the country's business climate, work on ways to use water sustainably for agricultural growth and strengthen workforce development. A key part of the project included training Moroccans to create pottery to sell domestically as well as internationally. But the pottery program was riddled with problems, the audit found. For example, a translator hired to translate the instructions from an English-speaking pottery trainer to Arabic-speaking attendees was not fluent in English, which resulted in communication breakdowns. Also, some of the materials used by the pottery trainer were unavailable in Morocco, and participants were unable to replicate the projects. The pottery trainer was forgetful. Ultimately, the audit found that the pottery portion of the competitiveness project was poorly implemented, had limited impact and its intended focus on women and youths was not fulfilled. In a November 2011 response letter, USAID/Morocco's mission director characterized the pottery training as a ""minor activity"" within the competitiveness project. The pottery training portion of the project represented only one part of the project’s engagement in the country’s pottery sector. In fiscal 2011, that component accounted for 8 percent of annual project spending, the mission director wrote. So is Handel’s claim correct? The former Georgia secretary of state who’s now a U.S. Senate candidate said that the federal government spent $27 million teaching Moroccans how to make pottery. This claim has been a popular touchstone for conservatives looking to shine a light on government waste. But a closer look at the facts shows that the $27 million was for an entire economic development program in Morocco, of which the pottery training was only a fraction of the cost -- about 8 percent of the total program. Some may still consider that amount, $2.2 million, a large expense for pottery training and promotion, but it is not close to the $27 million that Handel claimed. Her overall point that the program was a failure is supported by an inspector general’s audit that found that the pottery training was mismanaged, poorly organized and ineffective. Her statement contains an element of truth but overstates the cost and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

202,pomt-10396,"Obama's plan to raise the capital gains tax ""hurts the middle class.""",mostly false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/11/republican-national-committee-republican/mostly-higher-incomes-pay-capital-gains-tax-/,"In a new Web ad, the Republican National Committee attacks Sen. Barack Obama for his position on capital gains taxes. Obama advocates raising the long-term capital gains tax above its current 15 percent rate, a rate that is below most current income-tax rates. ""After just three years in the Senate, Barack Obama demonstrates his poor grasp of basic economic principles,"" a narrator says. ""While families face tough times his ideas to raise taxes are out of touch. His promise to nearly double the capital gains tax hurts the middle class,"" it states. The ad is right that Obama wants to raise the capital gains tax. He has said he wants to raise it as part of an overall strategy of asking wealthy people to pay more taxes. Depending on the circumstances, he would raise it no higher than 28 percent, the current rate for the top income-tax bracket. But would raising the capital gains tax hurt the middle class? We conclude the answer is largely no: Only a small percentage of middle-class taxpayers pay capital gains taxes, no more than 11 percent. On the other hand, among higher-income taxpayers, about 51 percent pay the capital gains taxes. Walk with us into a thicket of data from the Internal Revenue Service (C'mon ... It'll be fun!) and we'll show you how we came to these conclusions. We looked at data from 2005, the most recent year for which the IRS has released detailed data. First, we had to decide which taxpayers are ""middle class."" Based on the data brackets, we counted everyone who reported income of less than $200,000, which we think is fairly generous to the RNC's point. Two categories of income are subject to capital gains taxes: taxable net gains and capital gains distributions (typically profits from mutual funds that are not part of a retirement plan). A taxpayer can report income in one or both categories, although most file in the first category. We're counting both categories as different taxpayers because we can't know how many people report income in both categories. For this reason, our numbers are going to be slight overestimates. Again, this will favor the RNC's point. Next, we added up the number of taxpayers who reported income in those two categories, so we could find out how many taxpayers were subject to capital gains taxes in 2005. Among tax filers making $200,000 or less, about 14.3-million of 130.8-million filers reported income subject to capital gains taxes. That's about 11 percent. Among tax filers making more than $200,000, about 1.8-million of 3.6-million filers reported income subject to capital gains taxes. That's about 51 percent. So only 11 percent of what we're calling middle-class people report capital gains, while 51 percent of wealthier people report it. If we removed people reporting income of less than $25,000, that percent would drop to 8.5 percent. And if we also decided we were too generous with our definition of middle class, and only counted people making under $100,000, that percentage would drop further, to 6 percent. ""The capital gains tax largely affects very high-income people,"" said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., which both liberal and conservative economists consider credible. The ad then says the tax will hurt 100-million Americans who own stocks, a claim we looked at previously. We found that raising capital gains taxes would not directly affect most working people saving for retirement . Tax-exempt retirement accounts like 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are not subject to capital gains taxes. Most home sales are not subject to the capital gains tax either, an issue we've written about previously . The ad says that Obama's plan to raise capital gains taxes ""hurts the middle class,"" but it's hard to see how that's true of a tax that directly affects — at most — 11 percent of a very generous definition of the middle class. Are there a few middle-class people who pay the tax? Sure. But on the whole, capital gains taxes are disproportionately paid by higher-income brackets. We find the RNC's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",None,Republican National Committee,None,None,None,2008-06-11T00:00:00,2008-05-18,['None']

Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., was ""busted"" for routing millions of tax dollars into the pocket of her husband, business investor Joseph Shepard. Affordable housing projects in which Shepard has invested have received millions in federal subsidies during McCaskill’s two terms in office. But this headline spins the narrative in a way that could mislead readers — by making Shepard’s business success appear more nefarious than what has been reported. ""Shock report: Senator McCaskill busted funneling millions of tax dollars to her hubby,"" said a July 25 headline from Patriot Beat, a conservative website. The story quoted directly from a Breitbart News article, which in turn cited original reporting from the Kansas City Star. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Well, well, well, with a tight election coming up, Senator Claire McCaskill does not need a ‘scandal’ to crop up,"" the Patriot Beat story said above its repost of the Breitbart News story. ""However, that’s precisely what’s happened — and it’s a doozy … According to a new report, McCaskill has funneled her husband $131 million in federal subsidies."" While the Breitbart story relies on the Kansas City Star report, the Kansas City Star’s research does not support the implications embedded in the inflammatory Patriot Beat headline. Its loaded words, such as ""busted"" and ""funneling,"" paint what could very well be a total coincidence as a deliberate attempt by McCaskill to profit off of taxpayer money. Other headlines — such as the Kansas City Star’s ""Businesses linked to McCaskill’s husband get $131 million in federal dollars"" — were more precise. Here’s what actually happened. A July 24 analysis from the Kansas City Star revealed that businesses linked to Shepard have received approximately $131 million in federal subsidies since McCaskill took office in 2007. Specifically, government-subsidized housing projects in which Shepard has invested were awarded $62 million and $69 million during McCaskill’s first and second terms, respectively. The businesses Shepard has invested in participate in affordable housing programs through both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The USDA program subsidizes low-cost rental housing in rural areas for domestic farm laborers and low-income, disabled or elderly people. The federal subsidies compensate property owners on behalf of tenants who otherwise would not be capable of affording their full rent. Meanwhile, the HUD program contractually obligates private landlords and developers to reserve some housing units for cheap rental, and the subsidies again help to pay off part of the rent. Although Shepard gets only a fraction of each federal award as income — most of each subsidy contributes to covering operating costs for the projects — the Kansas City Star report noted that his personal income grew during McCaskill’s two terms in the Senate, from between $1,608 and $16,731 in 2006 to between $365,374 and $1,118,158 in 2017. According to the Kansas City Star’s analysis, ""a growing percentage of Shepard’s personal earnings come from new businesses he has invested in that are receiving federal awards, primarily rural rental assistance through the USDA."" The Kansas City Star also made clear, however, that there is ""no evidence that McCaskill played any part in directing federal funds to businesses affiliated with her husband."" McCaskill has voted for some omnibus spending bills that would have benefited affordable housing programs, but she has voted against others. She also does not sit on the Senate committees with jurisdiction over HUD and USDA, where she could have had more influence. Additionally, the Kansas City Star report noted that Shepard is now just a limited partner with most of the federally subsidized housing projects in which he invests. This means that he does not control day-to-day operations or the distribution of profits. The report also specified that Shepard’s investments in affordable housing predated his 2002 marriage with McCaskill. A spokesman for Shepard’s company, Sugar Creek, told the Kansas City Star that the company is involved with fewer government housing projects now than before Shepard married. Similar articles detailing subsidies provided to Shepard’s businesses also surfaced in 2012. ""Claire's work in the Senate has absolutely nothing to do with her husband's business investments,"" said Meira Bernstein, McCaskill campaign spokeswoman. Patriot Beat did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling A misleading headline said, ""Shock report: Senator McCaskill busted funneling millions of tax dollars to her hubby."" The article cited research from a credible newspaper — the Kansas City Star — showing that since McCaskill took office, her husband has seen his income increase at least in part because of federal subsidies awarded to housing projects that he has invested in. However, we found no evidence that McCaskill personally or deliberately routed any money to her husband’s businesses.

State Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, was asked during a Nov. 26, 2012, Texas Tribune event what he favors in state health care reform. Hunter replied: ""The first thing I prefer is transparency,"" adding that in his view, doctors, nurses and the people weren’t included in writing the federal act. ""And when you have amendments where Nebraska gets exempted from the taxation and then today we’re finding out you have real estate taxes being placed to pay for this?"" Hunter said. ""Actually, the biggest problem is how it was handled,"" Hunter said. First, let’s weigh the Nebraska exception. By email, Hunter told us he was referring to the so-called ""Cornhusker Kickback,"" which was a 2009 deal resulting in the Senate-approved version of the health care act giving Nebraska added federal Medicaid funds, as recapped by FactCheck.org in a December 2011 review. At the time the amendment was accepted, U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, declared he would vote for the overall proposal. However, the Nebraska provision was removed before the legislation passed into law, FactCheck noted. In turn, ""all states ended up with more federal funds, and they may well have Nelson to thank for it,"" FactCheck wrote. By phone, Hunter told us he had not said that the Nebraska amendment stuck in the plan because he didn’t know whether it did. He said he mentioned the amendment to demonstrate the deal-making that went on. In any event, his Nebraska reference could be taken as vague. So we’re focusing this fact-check on whether real estate taxes were put in place to fund Obamacare. Hunter pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2012, Forbes.com blog post by Michael Chamberlain, a personal financial planner. Headlined ""Will You Pay the New Obamacare Tax,"" the post says a surtax in the law means couples with incomes over $250,000 a year and singles earning more than $200,000 could see their taxes increase in 2013. He also nudged us to an undated publication on the tax from the National Association of Realtors, which says in part that the ""tax WILL NOT be imposed on all real estate transactions, a common misconception."" Indeed. In February 2011, PolitiFact debunked a claim that under Obamacare, all real-estate transactions would be subject to a 3.8 percent sales tax. That statement, rated Pants on Fire, is deceptive because a Medicare tax on investment income created under the law applies to the investment income of single taxpayers who make more than $200,000 or couples who make more than $250,000. (It’s spelled out in Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled ""Unearned income Medicare contribution."") That seems worth stressing. The tax would only apply to very high earners, accounting for no more than 2 percent of taxpayers, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Tax Policy Center, told us by telephone. For them, he noted, the tax would apply to the lesser of how much the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds the $200,000/$250,000 threshold or the amount that their investment gains exceeds the relevant threshold. And which investments might be subjected to the tax? According to the Internal Revenue Service, the Net Investment Income Tax applies, starting in 2013, to investment income for those very high earners from interest, dividends, capital gains, rental and royalty income and certain annuities plus income from businesses involved in trading financial instruments or commodities and businesses that are ""passive activities to the taxpayer,"" meaning they're held for the purposes of gradual long-term appreciation. Williams said he calls the tax an investment tax. ""When somebody says ‘real estate tax’ to me, I don’t think of the capital gains tax on real estate sales. I think of the property tax"" levied by local and state governments. ""This"" new tax ""has nothing to do with property taxes,"" Williams said. Separately, a director for the Washington-based Tax Foundation, which says it seeks sound tax policy, said the group does not call the tax a real estate tax. Joe Henchman said by phone: ""I imagine calling it a real estate tax could scare a lot of people, unnecessarily. Everyone is going to think it applies to them when 99 times out of 100, it won’t."" While few property owners would be affected in the tax’s early years, the foundation said in a Sept. 24, 2010, blog post that more home sellers could be hit as years pass because the tax changes were not indexed for inflation. PolitiFact has previously pointed out that homeowners will not be socked by the tax even if they make sales profits of hundreds of thousands of dollars. That’s because there’s a long-standing tax exemption on the profits from home sales. To be hit with the investment tax, you would have to clear more than $250,000 in profit off your home, which means at least $250,000 more than you paid for it. The ceiling is higher for a married couple. Married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit from home sales. And again, that's profit, not the sales price. Finally, we wondered how much total revenue the tax is expected to produce. Williams suggested we consider research by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which assists members of Congress on tax policy. The panel’s March 20, 2010, fiscal analysis of the health care law says that combined with a change in law stepping up payroll tax contributions by high-income taxpayers, the investment tax is expected to raise $210 billion from 2010 through 2019, a little under half of $438 billion in net revenue attributed to the overall law. Hunter later said he didn’t intend to scare anybody with his comment. ""We do need to make sure folks know how complicated this deal is,"" Hunter said. Our ruling Hunter said real estate taxes were put in place to pay for Obamacare. That’s an incomplete characterization, potentially leaving the misimpression we’ll all be ponying up every time we sell a property. In reality, the tax helping to fund the health care law is an investment tax solely affecting the very wealthiest taxpayers and then only touched off by super-sized profits from any of a variety of investment types. Real estate (including rents) fits into the big mix, giving the claim an element of truth. We rate it as Mostly False.",None,Todd Hunter,None,None,None,2012-12-06T16:00:00,2012-11-26,['None']
205,pomt-08214,"The Florida Supreme Court has ""no express authority in the Florida Constitution"" to remove questions from the ballot proposed by the Legislature.",mostly false,/florida/statements/2010/nov/18/dean-cannon/dean-cannon-says-state-supreme-court-lacks-express/,"In 2010, the Florida Supreme Court removed three proposed constitutional amendments from the Nov. 2 ballot. Florida House Speaker Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, a lawyer, bashed the court for doing so on Nov. 16, 2010, in his first speech as House speaker during the Legislature's one-day organizing session. ""As an attorney and an officer of the court, I believe fervently in a judicial branch that is strong and independent and fully empowered and equipped to fulfill its constitutional duties. But for the judiciary to be independent, it must also be impartial and apolitical. It must respect the co-equal executive and legislative branches, and it must protect their unambiguous constitutional powers, and it must practice the restraint that is built into our federal and state constitutions. And yet, over the past year three times we saw the work of a three-fifths super majority of this legislative branch, the elected representatives of over 18 million Floridians, demolished by five unelected justices of the Florida Supreme Court. This was done notwithstanding the fact that there is no express authority in the Florida Constitution for their doing so."" For this Truth-O-Meter we will explore, is there ""no express authority in the Florida Constitution"" for the state Supreme Court to remove amendments placed on the ballot by the Legislature? First, some background on the amendments in question that we gleaned from a Sept. 1, 2010, article in the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times. In a 5-2 ruling on Aug. 31, 2010, the Supreme Court struck three amendments from the November 2010 ballot: • Amendment 3: To grant extra tax breaks to first-time home-buyers. • Amendment 7: To ""clarify"" redistricting Amendments 5 and 6, which did remain on the ballot. • Amendment 9: To prohibit Florida from participating in a health insurance exchange that forces people to buy insurance, which was in reaction to the new federal health care law. First, we asked Cannon spokesperson Katherine Betta to provide proof that the Florida Supreme Court lacks ""express authority"" in the state Constitution to remove the ballot items. ""He has the text of the Constitution… express authority means authority that is expressly written into the Constitution,'' Betta wrote in an e-mail. ""The Constitution doesn’t provide express authority for the judicial branch to remove amendments placed on the ballot by the Legislature. It only provides authority to remove those placed by citizen petition."" These three ballot items were placed on the ballot by the Legislature, she wrote. We sent Cannon's claim to four professors who are experts in Florida constitutional law -- Joseph Little, Timothy McLendon and Jon Mills at the University of Florida and Donald Jones at the University of Miami. We also interviewed three lawyers who have argued amendment cases in Florida: Mark Herron, Barry Richard and Ronald Meyer. Most of the legal experts agreed that there is no ""express authority"" in the state Constitution -- no blunt, direct language that says the Supreme Court should review ballot items written by the Legislature. But most also said that doesn't matter. The Supreme Court clearly has jurisdiction, and it would be misleading to suggest otherwise. First, let's look at the legal documents that the professors cited -- the Florida Constitution and state statute 101.161. The state Constitution in Article 4 Section 10 expressly directs the Supreme Court to review amendments headed to the ballot that were written by citizens -- not the Legislature: ""The attorney general shall, as directed by general law, request the opinion of the justices of the supreme court as to the validity of any initiative petition circulated pursuant to Section 3 of Article XI. The justices shall, subject to their rules of procedure, permit interested persons to be heard on the questions presented and shall render their written opinion no later than April 1 of the year in which the initiative is to be submitted to the voters pursuant to Section 5 of Article XI."" But the Constitution in Article 11 Section 1, also allows the state Legislature -- by a three-fifths vote -- to put an amendment on a ballot. That section makes no mention of the Supreme Court. ""There is a distinct difference between citizen petitions and the Legislature’s express constitutional authority to place amendments before the people,"" Betta wrote. ""The Constitution does not provide express authority for courts to remove questions placed on the ballot by the Legislature, as Rep. Cannon discussed in his speech."" That's what Mills concluded about Cannon's claim: ""I think he is right. The only provision in the Constitution dealing with judicial review relates to (citizen) initiatives."" But the Supreme Court still has authority to review such legislative-proposed amendments. After the Legislature agrees to place a question on the ballot, someone can file a challenge at the trial court level, which can work its way to the appeals court and then the state Supreme Court. That's what happened in the case of the three legislative amendments in 2010. Several lawyers said the basis on which the Florida Supreme Court removed the Legislature's proposed amendments in 2010 was state law 101.161, which requires that such amendments be ""printed in clear and unambiguous language"" among other requirements. That statute doesn't directly state that the Supreme Court can review amendments for that purpose, but the lawyers said it doesn't have to -- individual statutes don't have to mention the court's jurisdiction. Meyer told us in an e-mail that the Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to review such a decision due to Article 5 Section 3 of the Constitution, which states that the Supreme Court: ""may review any order or judgment of a trial court certified by the district court of appeal in which an appeal is pending to be of great public importance, or to have a great effect on the proper administration of justice throughout the state, and certified to require immediate resolution by the Supreme Court."" Meyer also wrote: ""For nearly a century, the Florida Supreme Court has exercised its constitutional power to review proposed amendments."" Here is the full text of what Meyer wrote to us. ""You could say there is nothing red in the sky that allows the Supreme Court"" to review amendments, and that would also be true, Meyer said sarcastically in an interview. Richard, who has argued several amendment cases, said technically he agrees with Cannon that the Constitution lacks express authority for the Supreme Court, but the court can review amendments if a lawsuit is filed at the trial court. (It bears repeating: That's exactly what happened with these three amendments that angered Cannon.) ""Most Supreme Court authority isn't spelled out,'' Richard said. ""If you say that it has to be 'express authority' then the Supreme Court wouldn't be able to review any statutory provisions. You need to take the next step. He is correct that there is no express authority, I agree, but most of the authority of the Supreme Court isn't express -- it is inherent in its nature as the high court in this state."" We also sent Cannon's claim to the Florida Attorney General's office, which sometimes represents the Legislature in amendment challenges. Spokeswoman Sandi Copes sent back a link to the the 2000 Armstrong decision, which tossed out a death penalty amendment due to misleading ballot language after it was approved by voters in 1998. That ruling included this statement: ""Although the Constitution does not expressly authorize judicial review of amendments proposed by the Legislature, this Court long ago explained that the courts are the proper forum in which to litigate the validity of such amendments."" Let's look at what two professors wrote to us in e-mails: ""The Florida courts possess jurisdiction, upon proper complaint having been filed, to ascertain whether the Legislature’s prescribed standards have been satisfied,"" Little wrote. ""The statute does not exempt proposals adopted by the Legislature from review. Hence, although it is true that the Florida Constitution does not include express language on this point, it is well within the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to review the questions of law that arise under (state law.)"" The state Constitution, Little wrote, ""does not have express words pertaining to most of the other myriad issues the court considers. By contrast, the Supreme Court does have express authority to review constitutional amendments proposed by citizen initiatives. I do not disagree that the authority is not 'express.' I do disagree that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction."" And Jones wrote: ""The law is not always what is written down. What is express or written down can never be the limit of the law in a democracy. If that were so, most of the law of the 20th century including Brown v. Board of Education would be void."" (That's a reference to the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court school desegregation case.) Let's summarize: There is no sentence in the Florida Constitution that bluntly states, as UF's McLendon told us, ""Oh by the way the Supreme Court can review these amendments and kick them off the ballot.'' So technically, Cannon is correct that there is ""no express authority"" in the Constitution. But let's look at the context of Cannon's remarks: ""And yet, over the past year three times we saw the work of a three-fifths super majority of this legislative branch, the elected representatives of over 18 million Floridians, demolished by five unelected Justices of the Florida Supreme Court. This was done notwithstanding the fact that there is no express authority in the Florida constitution for their doing so."" Cannon is clearly raising questions about whether the Supreme Court overstepped its bounds here, implying that it lacked authority for its action and that it failed to respect the legislative branch. The legal scholars and lawyers we interviewed agreed that the Supreme Court does have jurisdiction to review those amendments. Or to put it in non-legal terms, big whoop that it lacks ""express authority"" in the Constitution -- the Supremes have every right to rule here. We rate this claim Barely True.

206,pomt-00255,"Says three research universities ""came out and said (CPS is) the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system.""",mostly false,/illinois/statements/2018/oct/05/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-exaggerates-what-studies-say-about-cps/,"Rahm Emanuel recently announced he won’t seek a third term as Chicago’s mayor, but he has continued to tout the city’s accolades, including recognition received in recent years for its improvements to public education. Last fall, we rated Mostly True a claim from a Chicago Public Schools press release that said its students were learning at a faster rate than their counterparts in 96 percent of U.S. school districts. That claim was based on findings from Stanford University that CPS students had improved at a faster rate on standardized test scores between third and eighth grade in recent years than their counterparts in most other U.S. school districts. But the report also noted that third- through eighth-graders in the nation’s third-largest district still perform below the national average, something the district’s glowing press release did not reflect. So we were curious what the mayor was referring to when he claimed a new title for CPS at a recent event: best among the nation’s largest districts. ""30 years ago ... William Bennett, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education, called the Chicago Public Schools the worst in the United States,"" Emanuel said while answering a question from an audience member at a forum hosted in Chicago by the New York-based Fortune magazine. ""Stanford, University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Chicago: all three, independently over 18 months came out and said it’s the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system."" Adam Collins, a spokesman for the mayor, pointed us to studies from each university that he said backed up the mayor’s claim. ""Reports from Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Chicago all identify CPS students as having the fastest growing or the highest attainment in the matter and context covered within each study,"" Collins wrote in an email. The Stanford report, from education equality expert Sean Reardon, was the same one CPS based its claim on last year. Reardon found Chicago had the highest test score growth rate between third and eighth grade of any large district in the nation. But nowhere does the report label CPS ""the best"" among large urban districts. ""We compared Chicago to the 100 largest school districts on measures of test score growth but not on other factors,"" Reardon said in a phone interview. The University of Chicago report cited by Emanuel’s office, which assessed college enrollment patterns among CPS graduates, was less analogous. It said the district’s four-year college enrollment rate of 44 percent exceeded that of New York City, Los Angeles, and Dallas and called the district ""a national leader in creating initiatives to support students in the transition to college."" But like the Stanford report, it did not go so far as to crown CPS’ school system the best overall among similar districts. It also noted that CPS’ community college enrollment rate was lower than rates for other urban school systems. The UIC report, meanwhile, found Chicago elementary students were outperforming their peers in the rest of the state on standardized tests in comparisons between demographically similar groups. But the study was limited to Illinois, meaning no other major urban districts were included. For national context, however, UIC researcher Paul Zavitkovsky did refer to Reardon’s report. Zavitkovsky also pointed us to Chicago’s recent performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, where the district’s eighth graders scored slightly above the 2017 average for large cities, ranking lower than three other major urban districts in both reading and math but higher in those subjects than more than a dozen others, including Los Angeles, D.C. and Dallas. ""I think the thing that’s fairest to say is that Chicago has made more progress toward school effectiveness than any large district in the country,"" Zavitkovsky said, adding that although academics must carefully define the terms of their research, the ""spirit"" of what the mayor said at the Fortune event was correct. Reardon took a similar view, noting that defining ""best"" remains something of an open question when it comes to evaluating school systems, complicated by the challenge of finding other measures of school quality tracked by all districts. He also pointed to college enrollment as another useful data point for making such an assessment. That context was missing entirely from the mayor’s remarks, however. Reardon’s research showing CPS students are improving the fastest among large districts comes closest to what Emanuel claimed. But even then, that’s far less emphatic than labeling CPS the best urban school system overall. Our ruling Emanuel said Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago all pronounced CPS ""the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system."" The mayor’s blanket assertion contains an element of truth — and some very good news — in that reports from all three universities underscored significant strides the district has made and ranked CPS at or near top of the list on certain measures of performance. But Emanuel dispensed with all the nuance in proclaiming CPS the ""best"" overall among big city districts, a declaration beyond the scope of any of the academic studies he cited to underpin his boast.

207,pomt-07921,"In September, the Department of Business and Consumer Services enacted a sudden 39% workers' compensation premium assessment by rule with little notice to the public.",mostly false,/oregon/statements/2011/jan/31/oregon-senate-republicans/did-oregons-worker-compensation-rate-rise-whopping/,"Earlier this month, Oregon Senate Republicans called for a two-year halt on agency rule-making. The thinking is that Oregon businesses, struggling to survive the downturn, don’t need the hassle and expense of burdensome new regulations. The minority caucus gave a number of examples of state agencies trying to strangle employers, including this one: ""In September, the Department of Business and Consumer Services enacted a sudden 39% workers' compensation premium assessment by rule with little notice to the public."" Lots of facts to check out in that one claim. Was it indeed sudden? Did the increase amount to 39 percent? And was the public shut out of the process? In other words, was this massive insurance increase rammed down our collective throats by a heavy-handed agency gone wild? To assess that, PolitiFact Oregon delved into the wonky world of workers’ compensation. Almost all employers are required tobuy this insurance, which pays for the medical care and wages of a worker who has been hurt on the job. The Workers' Compensation Division, within the Department of Consumer and Business Services, oversees the program. In September, as it does every year, DCBS announced new insurance premium costs for 2011. The average cost of $1.48 for every $100 of payroll is the same as last year’s. (It’s an average because costs differ based on type of business.) There are three components to the cost. The largest portion -- called the ""pure premium"" -- is set by an outside group and the agency usually adopts its recommendation. For this year, the pure premium dropped 1.8 percent to $1.27 per $100 on average. A second, far-smaller portion pays for return-to-work and other worker-benefit programs; this rate is set by the agency and for 2011 remained unchanged at 11 cents per $100. Now, the third portion is the controversial part. The ""premium assessment"" pays to administer the workers’ compensation system. The agency, which sets the rate, increased the cost from 4.6 percent of premiums last year to 6.4 percent this year -- a 39 percent increase. The increase is from 7.6 cents to 10.4 cents per $100 of payroll. Republicans don’t like it because it was proposed by the agency director in September and adopted two weeks later with one public hearing. DCBS spokeswoman Lisa Morawski doesn’t dispute the two-week open comment period, but she says stakeholders had earlier notice. Also, she said that DCBS had no choice, given an ongoing decline in revenue. Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, acknowledged the premium they cited was indeed part of an overall figure -- but argued the size of the increase is so large it deserves to be singled out. ""Anything that goes up by more than the rate of inflation is killing people who have to pay these fees,"" he said. ""You don’t mark up cars like that; you don’t mark up groceries like that."" Still, businesses actually saw no overall increase because the extra revenue from the premium assessment -- $17 million -- should balance out the reduction in pure premium. So how accurate is the statement? The numbers don’t lie. There was a 39 percent increase in the assessment portion. But the money involved is pennies on the dollar, literally: the average goes from 7.6 cents to 10.4 cents per $100. For most people unfamiliar with workers’ compensation lingo, they might think the overall rate went up 39 percent. And that’s not correct. We think the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Barely True. Comment on this item.

208,pomt-06945,"""I've created over 40,000 jobs.""",mostly false,/florida/statements/2011/jul/19/craig-miller/former-ruths-chris-ceo-craig-miller-says-he-create/,"Usually when politicians claim that they created jobs, they are talking about jobs created by the private sector while they held public office. And we're skeptical. But when that politician is a former Ruth's Chris Steak House chief executive running on his business credentials, well, we're curious. If a CEO can't take credit for job creation, who can? Craig Miller, a Republican who jumped into politics with a 2010 primary run for an Orlando-area congressional seat (he finished third), announced in July 2011 that he would run for the U.S. Senate. That made him a relative newcomer facing Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, former U.S. Sen. George LeMieux, former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner and former U.S. Army Col. Mike McCalister. (Haridopolos thinned the field by dropping out less than a week later.) Miller, 61, explained his decision to ""take on the career politicians"" in a four-paragraph essay on his website. Here's the third paragraph: ""Those that have had a chance to lead have failed us. The politicians we have trusted to represent us are the ones who have gotten us into the mess we now face. The time for new leadership is now. I'm a businessman. I've been fortunate enough to live the American Dream, starting in the dish room and working my way up to the board room. Along the way, I've created over 40,000 jobs and I've spent my career in the restaurant industry balancing budgets and meeting payroll. I know the kind of pro-growth and pro-job environment we need to get our economy moving again. My life experiences have prepared me to go to Washington and take on the career politicians and entrenched interests that only know how to spend your money."" We saw the same number in a campaign news release a day later and wondered: Did Craig Miller, restaurant executive, create 40,000 jobs? Here's how Miller told us he did the math. He explained that he started his executive career with the company that owned Red Lobster in 1973, back when the restaurant chain was only in the Southeast. (The company was called General Mills Restaurants, before General Mills spun it off as the behemoth Darden Restaurants in 1995. Heard of Olive Garden? LongHorn Steakhouse? Yeah, them.) Red Lobster's extraordinary growth — hundreds of new restaurants while Miller was there — meant lots of new jobs. In 1984 Miller joined Uno Restaurant Corp., helping transform pizza joint Pizzeria Uno into Uno Chicago Grill, where he landed his first CEO gig in 1996. By the time he left in 2001, Uno Chicago Grill had grown by more than 180 restaurants, creating yet more jobs. After a quick stint at already troubled Furr's Restaurant Group, he took on a higher-profile role at what became Ruth's Hospitality Group, where he was chief executive from 2004 to 2008. Before he left, he said, the high-end Ruth's Chris had added about 30 steak houses. So, to him, the math is simple: More than 700 new restaurants opened during his career, multiplied by an average number of about 60 new employees per restaurant, for more than 40,000 jobs. (For his specific estimates, see box.) Miller said his job claim did not include a National Restaurant Association stat-booster that says every restaurant job supports almost a full position elsewhere in the economy, which he figured would have put his job creation total ""somewhere north of 80,000 or 90,000."" ""I tried to be conservative, because I come from a financial analysis background,"" he said. ""I wanted to make sure we don't overstate what I've done."" With Miller's calculus in hand, we started our own search, chatting with folks and digging through old news clips and earnings releases to piece together the numbers — and Miller's role in them. We'll accept the average-employees-per-restaurant figure of 62.5 that Miller used in making his claim — after checking with experts and industry data. And his estimates for the numbers of restaurants that popped up during his tenure at a handful of companies, while not exact, were generally close when we spot-checked them against business stories and earnings reports from the time. As for his role: Certainly, the guy has a reputation as a growth machine. Chris Muller, the dean of hospitality administration at Boston University, was an expert in chain restaurants at University of Central Florida when he met Miller. He named Miller UCF's restaurateur of the year in 2000 and featured him at a European food service conference. He also invested in Ruth's Chris when Miller took it public in 2005. He described Miller's approach as ""very aggressive"" as the head of Uno, which grew from just 10 to 15 restaurants when he joined as a vice president to nearly 200 when he left as CEO, and said he was similarly expansion-focused at Ruth's Chris, where he took the company public, creating additional pressure for growth. ""So he does have a history of creating positions for people,"" Muller said. Of course, that growth also meant Ruth's Chris was stretched thin as the economy started to flail, and its stock price dove. The board asked Miller to leave in 2008. Miller's expansionist style had its ""positives and negatives,"" Muller said, but you couldn't deny he was a ""growth-oriented CEO."" But what about his role before he was a head honcho? Miller's campaign manager pointed us to Bill Bridges, who worked with Miller for most of the 1970s, starting at General Mills as director of personnel the year before Miller came on board. He recalls a bright, hard-working guy who analyzed sites for expansion and made presentations to the executive committee about where to build. ""From that perspective, he was integral to the growth of the company,"" he said. Miller's own two-page biography says he held positions at General Mills in finance, planning and analysis, development, real estate, corporate growth and purchasing. But he was there for over a decade. We had to know: Did he jump in with both feet, spawning Red Lobsters from his first months at General Mills in his early 20s? And that's when part of the story got off track. In 1996, when Miller was named CEO of Uno Restaurant Corp., the Boston Business Journal wrote a profile. It told of Miller's journey from high-school dishwasher to Vietnam Air Force veteran to accounting major at Florida State University. Then it described his start with General Mills in Tallahassee, after he wrote the company a letter asking about positions at Red Lobster. He didn't yet have his business degree, but ""in 1973 became a part-time auditor of the local restaurant."" Later, the article says, he was asked to audit the books of another Red Lobster in Central Florida. He finished his degree at University of Central Florida in 1974, it says, and started working in payroll. Eventually he became vice president of finance. Which means Miller claims to have created jobs at restaurants that sprang up as he was a 20-something part-time auditor and then a payroll employee. It's not clear how long it took for him to reach management. The claim gets even murkier when you look closely at his own bio. General Mills Restaurants' success was led by the blockbuster growth of Red Lobster, which by 1983 — just 15 years after the first restaurant opened — had 350 locations in 36 states and had started to reach into Japan, according to New York Times article at the time. But while Craig Miller's General Mills career started with paper-pushing, the last part focused on a chain with a far less impressive legacy than Red Lobster. As a finance guy, Miller had helped General Mills put together the acquisition of small Mexican food chain Casa Gallardo, according to the Boston Business Journal. His biography notes that after that deal in 1979, his ""primary duties"" were as vice president of the Mexican chain. Starting with just a handful of restaurants — one, according to his bio, or five, according to the Business Journal — Miller and Ramon Gallardo took the Casa Gallardo chain to 34. The goal, said an article at the time, had been 100. Not long after Miller had moved on to Pizzeria Uno, General Mills dumped the chain, which by then numbered just 25. It had been profitable for General Mills, just not profitable enough. ""We didn't get it all put together with the speed that enabled us to capitalize,"" company spokesman Dean Belbas told Minneapolis-St. Paul City Business shortly after the sale. Why does any of this matter? Well, in Miller's back-of-the-napkin math, new Red Lobsters made up nearly half the jobs he claimed credit for. But those include new Red Lobsters while he was a part-time auditor. New Red Lobsters while he worked in payroll. New Red Lobsters while he worked in finance. New Red Lobsters as he built Casa Gallardo. His campaign's response? ""He was the top financial and economic adviser to the CEO and was directly involved in all aspects of the company's business, even while serving as vice president of Casa Gallardo,"" campaign manager Paul Ciaramitaro said. ""Craig had a vital hand in the company expansion and job creation at General Mills during the 1970s and into the 1980s."" But was Miller ultimately responsible? More so than Red Lobster's founder, Bill Darden, or the man who followed in his footsteps, former Darden Restaurants chairman and CEO Joe Lee? Joe Lee did tell the Boston Business Journal in 1996 he considered Miller ""one of the industry's top leaders."" (We attempted to reach him at home, unsuccessfully.) But we would dare to speculate he wouldn't credit Miller with every job at every restaurant General Mills added from 1973 to 1984. Where does this leave us? Several folks told us that Miller's a respected restaurateur. Like Herman Cain, a former president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, he served in leadership there as chairman of the board. Companies grew dramatically under his corporate leadership. But to reach 40,000 jobs created, Miller takes credit for thousands of jobs he wasn't in a position to create. Growth at Red Lobster, early in his career, accounts for 46 percent of his estimate — and it's a stretch to credit him for even half of that. He also counts job gains only and not losses — something any politician relying on net job creation numbers can't do. And we can't know how many jobs he actually added to communities — for every Casa Gallardo, a local mom-and-pop may have closed or had layoffs — though in strong economies, every job may have indeed added to the overall total. Make no mistake, our reporting shows Miller was a gung ho restaurant CEO who stressed expansion and by extension, job creation. A lower jobs number may have rated higher on the Truth-O-Meter. But 40,000 jobs? He just hasn't proved it. We rate this claim Barely True. Jobs math Here's how Craig Miller breaks down his career job creation, with Red Lobster representing nearly half of the total: Ruth's Hospitality Group (2004-08) Miller's role: Joined as president and CEO; from Sept. 2006, also chairman of the board Restaurants added by company during tenure: 37 Estimated jobs created: 2,313 Uno Restaurant Corp. (1984-2001) Miller's role: Joined as vice president for administration responsible for development and franchising, became executive vice president/chief operating officer, then in 1996 president and chief executive officer Restaurants added by company during tenure: About 185 Estimated jobs created: 11,563 General Mills Restaurants (1973-84) Miller's role: Joined as part-time auditor before earning college degree; moved to payroll; held positions in finance, planning and analysis, development, real estate, corporate growth and purchasing; after acquisition of Casa Gallardo in 1979, primary duties were as vice president of Casa Gallardo Restaurants added by company during tenure: Casa Gallardo, about 30; Red Lobster, about 325; other brands, about 125 Estimated jobs created: 30,000 Total: 43,876 Sources: Craig Miller campaign, Boston Business Journal Notes: Restaurants added don't include acquisitions.

209,pomt-02287,"""If you want out of the individual mandate... all you have to do now is tick off the box that says 'hardship' and you're out.""",mostly false,/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/04/charles-krauthammer/charles-krauthammer-anyone-can-get-out-individual-/,"Individual mandate, schmindividual schmandate. There’s a quick, penalty-free fix for anyone who wants out of Obamacare’s health insurance requirement, says conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer. Just check a box. The one that says ""hardship."" That’s it, you’re done! There will be no questions, and no consequences. At least, that’s how easy Krauthammer made it sound during his April 1 appearance on The O’Reilly Factor. He and host Bill O’Reilly discussed the Democrats’ changes to the law since it passed in 2010. Krauthammer: ""They decide what the law is every Wednesday morning. They've changed it 38 times. The employer mandate is out. Remember the great debate in the country for two years over the individual mandate? ""The individual mandate no longer exists. They haven't said so officially, but if you want out of the individual mandate, do you know what you've got to do? ""You have to say that this is a hardship. There are hardship exceptions. It means, it was meant to mean, if there's a hurricane or a tornado and you're living out of the back of a pickup truck, you can opt out. All you have to do now is tick off the box that says 'hardship' and you're out."" O'Reilly: ""Yes, you don't even have to explain it."" Krauthammer: ""You don't have to explain --"" O'Reilly: ""And it can be as simple as 'I don't know how to work the computer, so I can't get it.' "" Krauthammer: ""Right. When you have an anonymous bureaucratic computerized system and then you use the word 'honor system' as the way of describing, you are deliberately misusing the language."" O’Reilly: ""I think the evidence is overwhelming that you are correct."" With an assurance like that from O’Reilly, we thought Krauthammer’s point merited a second look. Is it really so easy to get out of the insurance mandate by claiming a hardship? We know from a previous fact-check that the Internal Revenue Service cannot use the threat of jail time or property seizures to go after people who do not pony up the ""shared responsibility payment,"" or what’s sometimes referred to as the ""tax"" for not having health insurance even though you can afford it. That fee, which will be collected in 2015 for the filing of 2014 taxes, is 1 percent of annual income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is more expensive. The fee goes up every year. Already, some people are exempt for reasons including religious beliefs, prisoners, Indian tribes, income being below the federal filing level, and undocumented immigrants. The hardship exemption comes in when you don’t fall into those categories but have a reason for not having health insurance and paying the fine. In most cases, it’s because you can’t afford it. Getting one is not as easy as checking a box. Here’s the application from the Health Insurance Marketplace, which spells out 14 categories for the hardship exemption. It also says what form of documentation (hello, proof) you need to attach in order to qualify. Categories that require some form of documentation include being evicted or declaring bankruptcy in the last six months; receiving a shut-off notice from a utility; the death of a loved one; a human or natural disaster caused substantial property damage; racking up unexpected costs taking care of a family member; applying for but not receiving Medicaid because the state of residence did not expand Medicaid access envisioned in the law; and having medical expenses you couldn’t pay in the last two years. There’s also a hardship category for people whose health plans were canceled and they find other options unaffordable. Being homeless or suffering domestic abuse are the only categories that do not require some form of documentation. But then there’s the 14th category: ""You experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance."" Documentation should be submitted ""if possible."" Is that the magical ""other"" category promising safe haven for people who don’t want to pay the insurance penalty? ""Exemption 14 is broad, but not open ended,"" said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University professor who has studied the law. ""My understanding is that it is meant to give (Health and Human Services) the discretion to take into account hardships not specifically listed."" An unlisted hardship would have to be in the spirit of the other categories, he said, and it would not be permanent, if it’s granted at all. The Department of Health and Human Services will respond within one to two weeks to let someone know if more information is needed, the application says. If the exemption is okayed, the recipient gets a special number to include on his or her tax return. ""HHS could certainly deny a hardship exemption if there was insufficient documentation or explanation,"" Jost said. Gail Wilensky, an expert on the law who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said Krauthammer’s point isn’t that far from the mark, especially since ""the administration has shown itself to be extremely 'flexible' when it comes to any type of enforcement or timing thus far."" Still, there is some explaining required. There’s a box for applicants to describe how their hardship prevented them from getting health insurance, with exceptions for people turned down for Medicaid and health policy cancellations (which are proven by copies of a denial for Medicaid or notice of cancellation). People who submit hardship exemptions without really needing one should pay special attention to step three of the application. That’s the part where you sign, under penalty of perjury, that your exemption claim is honest. Lying is a crime. ""Only people who have a true, factual basis for their claims should be advised to file,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, George Washington University health and policy professor. Our ruling Krauthammer said people who don’t want to comply with the individual mandate should just ""tick off the box that says ‘hardship’ and you're out."" He is over-simplifying the process. Included in the hardship exemption application -- because there’s an application, you don’t just check a box on your tax form -- is a 14th category that reads kind of like ""other."" It’s meant to catch examples of hardship not delineated in the form. Documentation is requested if possible. Again, claiming it doesn’t mean you get it. You apply. And just because you ask does not mean you will receive. We rate the claim Mostly False.",None,Charles Krauthammer,None,None,None,2014-04-04T10:20:21,2014-04-01,['None']

Gwen Graham has promoted public education as her top priority in her campaign for governor, and she has openly criticized the charter school industry for drawing money away from traditional public schools. In an interview with editorial boards from major South Florida newspapers, Graham argued that some charter schools in Florida provided a subpar education. She said, ""The teachers in (charter) schools don't even have to be certified."" Charter schools operate as independent contractors within the public school system. These schools generally have more freedom to experiment than traditional public schools. Many are catered to specific subjects, like science or art, and some are organized for students with disabilities. However, with that increased freedom, charter schools are required to perform to a certain standard, and may be shut down if they fail. Most charter schools in Florida are run by the same statutes that govern public schools, and would therefore need certified teachers. But does Florida hold all charter schools to the same regulations? Depends on the charter According to the Florida Department of Education, most charter school teachers are required to be certified. The certification process is mandated by the Florida K-20 Education Code, a subset of the 2018 Florida Statutes. Statute 1002.33 reads, ""Teachers employed by or under contract to a charter school shall be certified as required by chapter 1012."" Statute 1012, the same rule that governs traditional public schools, requires teachers to ""hold the certificate required by law and by rules of the State Board of Education"" in order to teach. However, certification is not mandatory for a subset of Florida charter schools, called the ""schools of hope."" These charter schools operate within underserved districts that have ""persistently low-performing schools."" The legislature hoped to attract successful charter organizations from other states by offering financial incentives and increased administrative freedom. Gov. Rick Scott signed the controversial bill, known as HB 7069, into law in July 2017. Graham did not specify in her interview with the editorial boards that she was referring to these schools. Her campaign clarified when we contacted them, and linked us to the bill. According to HB 7069, ""schools of hope"" can hire administrators and ""instructional personnel"" who do not meet the requirements for public school teachers, so long as they have not been convicted of any felonies or other serious crimes. Instructional personnel include lead classroom teachers. To obtain a Florida teaching certificate, teachers must have a bachelor’s degree and complete several state accreditation tests. Most notable are the Florida Teacher Certification examinations, which include a general knowledge test, a professional education test, and a subject area test. A school of hope teacher would not be required to pass any of these tests. As of August 2018, no ""schools of hope"" have opened in Florida. Four companies have been approved as ""hope operators,"" but none intend to begin operation for this school year. Thirteen counties have filed a lawsuit against HB 7069, arguing that it restricts the rights of districts to operate freely and violates the constitutional right to a uniform system of public schools. ""Gwen believes charter schools must be held to the same standards as traditional public schools and, as governor, will fully enforce certification requirements,"" said Graham campaign spokesman Matt Harringer in an email. Our ruling Graham said that ""The teachers in (charter) schools don't even have to be certified."" At every charter school currently operating in Florida, teachers are held to the same certification standards as they would be in public schools. At ""schools of hope,"" a recently introduced subset of charter schools, teachers will not need to be certified. Even when these schools begin operation, they will make up only a small percentage of the state's 654 existing charter schools. It is misleading to say that teachers in charter schools don't have to be certified when the vast majority of them do. We rate this claim Mostly False.

At a debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Jan. 10, 2008, Huckabee repeated a claim he has made several times about how much Arkansas' roads improved. ""I took on the worst road system in the country, according to Trucker's magazine,"" Huckabee said. ""When I left, they said it was the most improved road system in the country."" We find Huckabee glosses over some details but is right that his state made big improvements. First, we couldn't find such an article in ""Trucker's magazine"" ... because we couldn't find a magazine by that name. It's clear he is referring to an annual survey done by Overdrive magazine (""The voice of the American trucker""), which asks truck drivers to name the best and worst highways. When Huckabee took office in 1996, Overdrive's survey said Arkansas' roads were fifth worst in the United States. The state kept slipping in the rankings and by 2000 it was indeed the worst in the nation. The shoddy highways persuaded the Arkansas Legislature to raise gasoline and diesel taxes in 1999, which paid for major repairs to the state's road network. That helped. By 2004, Arkansas was rated the state with the most improved roads in Overdrive's annual survey. In 2006, Huckabee's last full year in office, Overdrive did not do overall rankings for the states, so it's a stretch for him to say they were most improved ""when I left."" However, the truckers that year listed Interstate 40 in Arkansas as the most improved road in the nation. Interstate 30 in Arkansas was No. 4 on the list. Yet despite the improvement that occurred under Huckabee, the state's roads still rate near the bottom overall. In the January 2008 issue, Arkansas is rated fifth worst – the same as when Huckabee took office. ""They have done a lot of work,"" said Andy Duncan, a senior editor for the magazine. ""Nevertheless, the consensus is that they have a ways to go."" And so while Huckabee is right that the state earned the honor for the most improved roads at one point in his term, it's a stretch to say that was the case when he left office. And Arkansas still lags behind other states. So we rate Huckabee's claim Mostly True.",None,Mike Huckabee,None,None,None,2008-01-11T00:00:00,2008-01-10,['None']

The race toward the primaries and the White House is starting, and the two major parties are, as usual, the ones to watch. Or are they? On a segment of Meet the Press this past Sunday, moderator Chuck Todd brought up a third group that may be just as important as the two major parties in the upcoming election. ""The growing number of voters who don't affiliate with either major political party is reshaping our political system, perhaps more than you may realize,"" Todd said. Todd went on to describe how, according to a recent poll, a larger percentage of Americans identify as independent rather than as Democrat or Republican. Todd cited Florida as a specific example. ""The number of voters (in Florida) who now register as ‘other’ has grown by a million in the last 10 years,"" Todd said. ""Compare that with the Democrats, who only grew by 300,000 and the Republicans who grew by just 200,000."" Has the number of independents really increased by a million? And what do those changes mean? Starting with 2014 as the most recent complete year, PunditFact looked at Florida voter data going back to 2004. We looked at last voter registration report before the November election. The chart below summarizes what we found. Registered Republican voters Registered Democrat voters No Party Affiliation 2004 3,892,492 4,261,249 1,886,013 2014 4,172,232 4,628,178 2,778,547 10-year change 279,740 366,929 892,534 Percent increase 7.19% 8.61% 47.32% The numbers are relatively close to what Todd said. (After hearing from Todd's staff, the differences mainly appear to be the result of rounding and whether or not you count minor parties such as the Reform Party, the Constitution Party and the Florida Socialist Workers Party, among others.) So the numbers are in the ballpark. Still, there are a few caveats to consider. No Party Affiliation is a catch-all Florida’s most recent voter registration form became effective in October 2013. In the Party Affiliation box, registrants are asked to choose whether they are affiliated with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, a minor party, or no party at all. However, if left blank, registrants are automatically registered as having no party affiliation. PunditFact has asked the Florida Department of State how many people are registered with No Party Affiliation because they left the field blank. If we get an answer, we’ll update this item. No Party Affiliation doesn’t translate to no party In an article published in 2014 by Politics in Polk, Kevin Wagner, an associate professor of political science at Florida Atlantic University, warned about some additional nuances that are necessary to consider when talking about independent voters. ""We have leaners or loosely affiliated voters,"" Wagner said. ""Sometimes partisan voters like to call themselves independent. So just asking that question can be inaccurate."" According to one 2009 article, once all the ""leaners"" are taken out of consideration, the pure independents actually end up totaling less than 10 percent of registered voters (with the leaners, independents total about 43 percent of the total registered voters). PunditFact also reached out to John Brehm, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. Brehm said it might be helpful to think of the ""other"" voters Todd mentioned as being divided into two categories. Young voters who have not yet formed a definitive identity mainly constitute the members of the first category. ""The majority of these individuals will eventually come to identify with their parents’ party identities,"" Brehm said. ""Some ... will be influenced by short term forces, typically economic, although sometimes having to do with major foreign policy crises (such as Sept. 11)."" The other category of voters, described by Brehm as those who ""left their partisan identity,"" includes ""longtime Republicans or Democrats who say ‘their party has left them’."" ""Nearly all of these people will come to vote with their prior identities, and another large share will simply not vote,"" said Brehm. As far as not voting goes, the numbers at the polls seem to support this. In the 2014 midterm election, 28 percent of the voter turnout identified as independent. However, at the time, a Gallup poll recorded that independent voters made up 43 percent of registered voters. As Todd even put it during his show, ""Even as the number of Americans identifying as independents has grown, we haven't seen a jump in the number of independent candidates, certainly none that are actually gaining traction, because there are none in the (presidential) race."" Our ruling Todd said that ""the number of voters (in Florida) who now register as ‘other’ has grown by a million in the last 10 years,"" while registered Democrat and Republican voters grew by 300,000 and 200,000 respectively. In Florida, voters who do not indicate affiliation on their registration forms are automatically placed in the No Party Affiliation category, artificially inflating the number of seemingly independent voters. And among voters registered as having No Party Affiliation, many still vote according to partisan lines. Still, the numbers are fairly close, and the trend is certainly spot on. Todd’s statement is accurate but needs some additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

213,pomt-13186,"Says Donald Trump is ""the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton/trump-first-ever-candidate-not-say-hell-accept-ele/,"Politicians and commentators on both sides of the aisle have expressed shock at Donald Trump’s refusal to say he’ll accept the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. Many have said Trump’s comments, as well as his baseless accusations that the election is ""rigged,"" are unprecedented in modern politics. That includes his opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""During that debate, Donald said something — well, he said a lot of things that were troubling. But he said something truly horrifying: He became the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election,"" Clinton said at an Oct. 24 rally in New Hampshire. ""Now that is a direct threat to our democracy."" We wondered if Trump really is the first presidential candidate in American history who would not say that he’ll accept the election results. It’s difficult to prove a negative. But historians and experts in campaign rhetoric told us that while campaigns have challenged results after Election Day, they are unaware of any prior presidential candidate casting so much doubt about an election before it even happens. Before we get into the historical context, let’s take a quick look at Trump’s exact words from the final presidential debate Oct. 19. Moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if he would ""absolutely accept the result of this election."" ""I will look at it at the time,"" Trump said. ""I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time."" ""But, sir,"" Wallace said, ""there is a tradition in this country — in fact, one of the prides of this country — is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?"" Trump responded, ""What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. Okay?"" The fact that Trump has to answer a question like this is a first, said Tammy Vigil, a Boston University professor who researches campaign rhetoric. There’s no precedent for a major party candidate being so publicly skeptical of an upcoming election. ""Most major party candidates do not make contesting the results an issue; it is simply assumed that they will accept the outcome of the vote,"" Vigil said. ""For that reason few candidates are ever asked the question in as direct a manner as Trump was asked it in the debate. The fact of him having to answer a direct query makes it unusual, and so his answer is unusual."" Historical context Trump is certainly not the first candidate in recent memory to question whether there will be voter fraud. In 2008, Republican nominee John McCain said the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Acorn, was ""on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy."" McCain's statement and others like it, though, are not equivalent to saying they might not accept the final results. Historians pointed out several examples of elections in the 19th and 20th centuries when the popular vote or electoral college vote was so close that the final results were controversial. But in none of those cases did the presidential candidate challenge the election before it took happened. Take the most recent example: the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the results of which eventually came down in a Supreme Court decision. In that case, it wasn’t until after Election Day that Gore requested the recount in Florida. After an exceptionally close race between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy in 1960, some Republicans called for a recount, but Nixon distanced himself from them. In the 1800s, several elections fell into the hands of Congress. In those cases, the political parties questioned whether the final results — not the popular vote but the pending congressional decisions — would be legitimate, said Alex Keyssar, a Harvard University professor and expert in voting history. However, he added that the candidates themselves did not question the legitimacy of the outcome before the election took place. And eventually, they conceded, said Brian Rosenwald, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Even in 1800, 1824 and 1876, where resolutions took almost until Inauguration Day, we had an outcome accepted, if grudgingly and with concessions, from both parties,"" Rosenwald said. ""People on the losing sides in these elections, as well as 1960 and 2000, often went to their graves believing that they’d had an election stolen from them, but they didn’t move to start or encourage a rebellion."" Also notable is the 1860 race. In the lead-up to that election, politicians in several southern states plotted to secede if Abraham Lincoln were to win, said Daniel Feller, a professor of mid 19th century history at the University of Tennessee. Lincoln won, the southern states seceded, and the country descended into civil war. But none of the four presidential candidates that year advocated on the campaign trail for secession if Lincoln were to win, Feller said. Additionally, the South viewed the election results as legitimate and as confirmation that the northern states wanted to stifle their way of life. ""Have other presidential candidates announced beforehand they would not accept the results of the election? Not to my knowledge,"" Feller said. ""But has there been a case when enough Americans rejected the results of the election to disrupt the system? Yes."" Our ruling Clinton said Trump is ""the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election."" There are examples of presidential campaigns challenging elections or raising concerns about corruption after Election Day. But historians and experts cannot point to an example of a presidential candidate himself refusing to say he would accept the results before the election even happens. We couldn't find one, either. If an example of a past presidential candidate saying something equivalent to Trump comes up, or if we find additional information to support Clinton's claim, we’ll update our story.

He said, “If we don't act, 14,000 Americans will continue to lose their health insurance every single day.” The White House told us the number came from a report published by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and authored by researchers James Kvaal and Ben Furnas. A chart in the report was headlined, “14,000 People Became Uninsured Every Day in December and January.” We wondered about the methodology and whether the December and January numbers were out of date. We couldn't reach the authors of the study (one has since joined the White House staff). But we tracked down Urban Institute health care scholar John Holahan, whose work was cited in the Center for American Progress study. Holahan was the co-author, with A. Bowen Garrett, of the January 2009 study, “Rising Unemployment, Medicaid and the Uninsured,” published by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. That study provided the underpinning for the Center for American Progress report by estimating how many people can expect to lose their insurance when the national unemployment rate goes up. Holahan and his co-author, using a baseline of 4.6 percent unemployment in 2007, calculated that 2.6 million people would lose coverage if the unemployment rate climbed to 7 percent; 3.7 million if it went to to 8 percent; 4.8 million at 9 percent; and 5.8 million at 10 percent. The estimates took into account people who lost their jobs but then switched to a spouse’s plan or extended their coverage through COBRA, the federal law that guarantees people who lose their job can still get continued health coverage. Applying Holahan's calculations to the actual rise in unemployment from November 2008 to June 2009, we came up with 3.2 million people losing health coverage, or an average of 15,238 per day, so it is close to the 14,000 Obama cited. We asked other health care experts about Holahan’s work, and they uniformly agreed that he is a respected researcher. Only one complicating factor emerged, when we spoke with Edmund F. Haislmaier of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He noted that Holahan’s paper was written before passage of the federal stimulus package, which contains provisions subsidizing 65 percent of COBRA costs for the unemployed. If these new subsidies end up boosting the use of COBRA — the data hasn't been compiled yet — then it could reduce the number of newly uninsured Americans from the levels that Holahan had predicted and that Obama cited. Obama was very close to Holohan's calculations — in fact he was slightly low. But as Haislmaier pointed out, the stimulus COBRA provisions could reduce the numbers because more people will still be covered. We can't be sure until the data is in. So in the meantime, we find Obama’s claim Mostly True.",None,Barack Obama,None,None,None,2009-07-24T14:33:52,2009-07-22,['United_States']

The Republican congressman, who represents parts of central New Jersey, took to the House floor on March 8 to denounce a new proposal: ""after-birth abortion."" During his speech, Smith said: ""since 1973"" -- when the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in the Roe v. Wade case -- ""well over 54 million babies have had abortion forced upon them."" Now, he said, this ""perverse proposal"" for ""after-birth abortion,"" or killing a newborn in all cases where abortion is permissible, has emerged. PolitiFact New Jersey will leave others to debate ""after-birth abortion."" We decided to look only at Smith’s claim about the number of abortions. First, let’s note that some abortion rights supporters contest using words such as babies and children in describing unborn fetuses. Jeff Sagnip, Smith’s public policy director, dismissed that argument, saying ""to object to the use of the term ‘babies’ in this context is out of step with common use."" And it’s clear Smith was referencing the number of abortions since 1973, so that’s what we are fact-checking here. Sagnip referred us to a report from the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion, that claims there have been more than 54.5 million abortions through 2011. The committee’s total is based on data collected by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that advocates on issues of sexual and reproductive health. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also collect data on abortions, but states aren’t required to report to the federal agency so the numbers are incomplete in some years. And people on both sides of the abortion debate largely consider the Guttmacher Institute the authority for this type of data. The institute has tracked roughly 49.3 million abortions through 2008 from surveys of abortion providers. The National Right to Life Committee estimates the total through 2011 by assuming the number of abortions in 2008 -- about 1.2 million -- stayed the same. That puts the total near 53 million, a reasonable estimate, according to a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute. But the committee also adds 3 percent for a possible under-reporting rate, which pushes the total above 54 million. The Guttmacher Institute found its 1992 survey overlooked some small providers and suggested that the number of abortions was actually between 3 percent and 4 percent more than reported. In its most recent report, the institute said: ""undercounting has likely become more pronounced over the last decade"" because of early medication abortions at facilities that don’t offer surgical abortions. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said the Guttmacher Institute ""acknowledges the potential underreporting in our abortion reporting, but we do not adjust the figures to account for underreporting. Rather, we report the actual number of abortions that are reported to us, so we are confident in this figure. We then acknowledge the level of potential underreporting in the reporting of those data."" Our ruling Smith said that since 1973, when the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roe v. Wade, there’s been ""well over"" 54 million abortions. The Guttmacher Institute has tracked roughly 49.3 million abortions through 2008. If the recent trend of about 1.2 million abortions per year holds true through 2011, it’s reasonable to assume the total is now close to 53 million. Even by that figure, Smith is close. The Guttmacher Institute acknowledges the potential for underreporting in its data, but does not adjust its figures. The statistic Smith cites relies entirely on the Guttmacher Institute data, except it adds 3 percent to adjust for the potential underreporting -- a calculation the institute doesn’t support. Either way, both totals through 2011 are subject to projections and estimates, and for that reason we rate this claim Mostly True.

216,pomt-06859,Says more than eight countries lead the United States in the percentage of college graduates.,mostly true,/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/03/cory-booker/newark-mayor-cory-booker-claims-united-states-trai/,"Newark Mayor Cory Booker said he was disgusted and angry. With federal officials mired in debate over raising the nation’s debt ceiling, Booker appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 24 to discuss political gridlock in the nation’s capital. The generation of the Great Depression built the Hoover Dam and the Empire State Building at that time of crisis, but now ""Rome, our capital, is fiddling with itself while the nation is burning,"" Booker said. Booker then pointed out how the United States has fallen behind other countries in the percentage of college graduates it produces. ""We are a nation that, in that generation said, you know, ‘We're going to go to the moon. And we're going to do math and science and make sure that our kids are prepared to go there.’ But right now what's happening?’"" Booker said. ""Nations are passing us in droves. Over eight different countries now have a higher proportion of people graduating from college than we do."" PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Booker’s claim about the country’s college graduation rate was mostly right. In terms of young adults with the equivalent of an associate’s degree or higher, the United States is tied for ninth among the 36 countries analyzed by the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. First, let’s talk about how Booker received his numbers. The mayor’s spokeswoman referred us to an Oct. 19, 2010 speech by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, in which he said: ""Today, in eight other nations, including South Korea, young adults are more likely to have college degrees than in the U.S."" U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman Jane Glickman provided statistics from ""Education at a Glance 2010: OECD Indicators,"" which compares countries based on 2008 data. The OECD includes 34 member countries and works with other partner countries. According to that 2010 report, the United States ranked ninth in the percentage of people between ages 25 and 34 to achieve an associate’s degree or higher. At 42 percent, the United States was tied with Israel, Belgium and Australia, according to the report. The eight countries leading the United States in that age group were South Korea at 58 percent, followed by Canada, Russian Federation, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Ireland and Denmark, according to the report. Older generations in the United States have fared better than in its OECD counterparts. The United States ranked higher in the percentage of adults between ages 35 and 64 who have college degrees, according to the report. ""Not too long ago we ranked at or near the top in the world, and while our rate has grown very slowly, other countries have experienced rapid increases and overtaken us,"" Glickman wrote in an email, adding ""we must sit up and take notice, especially since a degree is increasingly important for job opportunities in a changing economy."" So Booker was right about young adults being more likely to have college degrees in eight other countries. But Andreas Schleicher, head of the OECD's Indicators and Analysis Division in the Directorate for Education, said in an email that one should not put too much emphasis on small differences between countries, because of the varied educational systems. Large proportions of young people in Germany and Austria enter apprenticeship arrangements, instead of higher education, Schleicher said. Russian Federation’s high graduation rate is related to short-term engineering studies that may not exist in other countries or only at the upper secondary level, which is comparable to high school in the United States, he said. ""A range of factors may affect the figures including the organization of the education and training system and government policies regarding education,"" Schleicher said in the email. Alan Ruby, a senior fellow in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania, said four of those eight countries leading the United States don’t make for good comparisons because of their smaller sizes. But why does the United States rank below some of the other countries? Schleicher suggested the tuition fees in the United States -- the highest in the OECD -- affect participation rates. Ruby said some young people falsely believe there aren’t benefits to attending college. Let’s review: Booker said the United States trails ""over eight different countries"" in college graduates. The mayor shouldn’t have included the word ""over"" in his statement, but he’s on target when it comes to the younger generation of college graduates. But since each country may have different educational policies affecting the overall rankings, we rate the statement Mostly True.

217,pomt-09342,"Says she introduced a ban on ""dirty dancing.""",mostly true,/florida/statements/2010/apr/09/frederica-wilson/wilson-banned-dirty-dancing/,"State Sen. Frederica Wilson, a Miami Gardens Democrat running for the congressional seat now held by Kendrick Meek, is making an unusual boast about her accomplishments as a school board member: She says she introduced a ban on ""dirty dancing."" Here is what she says on her campaign Web site: ""As a member of the Miami-Dade County School Board, Senator Wilson introduced reading labs and an African-American history curriculum into our schools, as well as a dirty-dancing ban in our community."" She reiterated that claim in a March 9, 2009 press release announcing her campaign and on her Facebook page -- so there's no doubt she's against kids engaging in nasty booty moves. Pelvic thrusts aren't usually mentioned in congressional campaigns, so we jumped at the chance to explore whether she truly had introduced a ban. First, some background on dirty dancing. To many, the phrase conjurs up memories of the 1987 movie starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Remember the story? Grey plays a good girl nicknamed ""Baby"" who is on a family vacation at a Catskills resort. She stumbles upon a room where the working-class crew -- including Johnny, a beer-swigging-shirt-unbuttoned dance instructor played by Swayze -- are grinding their scantily clad bodies wrapped around each other in Do You Love Me. Johnny teaches Baby to dance -- among other, ahem, lessons -- and they fall in love. She learns some choreographed dance moves that are more of the gaze-into-each-other's-eyes variety than the make-your-grandma-blush type. In one famous scene, he lifts her by her hips as she is dripping wet in a lake. A decade later, the Miami-Dade school board took up the topic. There was no mention of the movie in the articles we found about the mid 1990s discussions, but there was plenty of harrumphing about kids dancing in sexually suggestive ways. ""I've seen it in little tiny elementary school children. I couldn't take it, "" Wilson said in a Nov. 19, 1995, Miami Herald article which stated that she asked school administrators to hold a meeting on the topic. ""I don't think it sets a good standard for our district. We cannot allow (the dancing kids) to degrade the school district or themselves."" In a 1997 op-ed, school board member Wilson said she was considering introducing a ban. ""It has been called 'dirty dancing,' but it's really nothing more than simulated sexual intercourse. Outrageously, too many folks involved with Dade County's public schools -- including teachers, administrators, and parents who ought to know better -- call it 'cheerleading,' 'marching,' or other types of school-sponsored student performance. Whatever it's called, it's vulgar and degrading. It has no place in our schools, on our playgrounds, or in our students' lives. So, imagine my disgust and dismay when I marched in Dade's Martin Luther King Day Parade earlier this year and saw Dade high school cheerleaders bumping and grinding their way down Martin Luther King Boulevard."" In a July 1997 news article, she was quoted saying, ""I've seen horrendous behavior. I saw a band member bend over and a female majorette come from behind and simulate actual intercourse. I almost passed out, but people in the stands were applauding."" Rather than calling it a ""dirty dancing ban,"" it was known as ""Guideline 25B: Student dance performances and/or productions: Procedures for promoting and maintaining a safe learning environment."" The board's explanation of the rule said that cheerleading, dance and band performances at events, performances or educational settings ""are essential to the establishment and maintenance of an atmosphere that fosters cultural and artistic exchanges. However the board recognizes that certain modes of dance are inappropriate, unsuited for immature audiences and may offend the community's sense of propriety rather than foster appropriate conduct that is consistent with school board rules and state statutes."" School board documents said the rule prohibited performances that depicted ""actual or simulated sexual intercourse (normal or deviate), masturbation, excretory functions and actual lewd exhibition of genitalia."" It's clear from news coverage and school board minutes that Wilson was the driving force behind the ban. School board minutes for the July 9, 1997, meeting state that Wilson proposed the rulemaking. The motion passed unanimously. On Aug. 27, 1997, the school board voted again in favor of the proposal. But there's still a bit of exaggeration in her statement: Wilson described this as a ban ""in our community"" when it strictly related to school-related groups or performances. She told us that was a reasonable description because ""the dirty dancing ban was on school bands and majorettes in the community. We have a lot of parades -- the MLK parade, different half time shows at football games in the community. I witnessed it -- a lot of forward-thrusting of the pelvic bone."" Clearly Wilson introduced the dirty dancing ban approved by the school board in 1997 and we don't doubt that school activities now have less forward-thrusting of the pelvic bone. But her claim that the ban would apply ""in our community"" is a little misleading. Some people might think her ban applied to the entire county, not just the schools. So we rate this claim Mostly True.",None,Frederica Wilson,None,None,None,2010-04-09T14:37:08,2010-04-09,['None']
218,pomt-00344,"Says Leah Vukmir was ""just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies"" and ""voted against oral chemotherapy.""",mostly true,/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/14/tammy-baldwin/insurers-leah-vukmir-opposed-wisconsin-law-forcing/,"A TV ad by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin attacks Leah Vukmir, her Republican rival in the Nov. 6, 2018, election, over oral chemotherapy and insurance companies. The ad from the Wisconsin Democrat, unveiled Sept. 10, 2018, features a Manitowoc woman who says: I’m 44 and I just finished my last chemo for a brain tumor. It was oral chemo, the only chemo for my kind of cancer. So, I’m glad that Republicans and Democrats made the insurance companies in Wisconsin cover oral chemo. Who would say no to that? Leah Vukmir. She was just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies instead of the people. Leah Vukmir, you ought to be ashamed. At one point, a photo of Vukmir is shown with these words on the screen: ""Voted against oral chemotherapy."" The references are to votes by Vukmir, who is a state senator, on a bill that was later signed into law. Let’s see if Vukmir was ""just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies"" and ""voted against oral chemotherapy."" All our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. The law The law, signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker in April 2014, makes it easy for cancer patients to afford oral chemotherapy, such as the pills the woman in the ad took. It prohibits health insurance plans from charging higher copayments, deductibles or coinsurance for oral chemotherapy than they do for injected or intravenous chemotherapy. Before the law, health plans typically covered oral chemotherapy under prescription drug plans that could have high copays; for some health plans, those copays could run into many thousands of dollars. In contrast, chemotherapy administered at a hospital or clinic was covered as part of a health plan's standard medical coverage — with no additional cost to the patient after the deductible was reached. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Vukmir’s votes Vukmir was one of two Republican senators to come out vocally against the bill and in support of insurers. She said at the time: ""I have a consistent record of opposing insurance mandates. A state mandate would only impact the insurance companies regulated by Wisconsin and not those regulated at the federal level, creating an uneven playing field and driving up costs for consumers."" The bill was opposed by the Wisconsin Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group, as well as another trade group, the Alliance of Health Insurers, and individual insurers. Insurers said the measure would drive up costs on insurance premiums and make it harder for employers and consumers to afford coverage. When the measure came to a vote in the Senate, Vukmir and GOP Sen. Paul Farrow cast the only no votes. The measure passed, 30-2. After changes were made to the bill in the Assembly, the Senate approved the bill again, 26-7. Vukmir again voted no because of her opposition to putting mandates on insurers; the other six senators said the changes weakened the bill. So, Vukmir was nearly alone in her opposition to an oral chemotherapy bill that was opposed by insurance companies. Her campaign told us that ""when government mandates price structures, providers eliminate coverage options and fewer people end up with quality care."" But to be clear, her vote wasn’t against oral chemotherapy, per se. Rather, the law requires that insurers treat oral chemotherapy like traditional chemotherapy when it comes to how much patients must pay. Our rating Baldwin says Vukmir was ""just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies"" and ""voted against oral chemotherapy."" On the main vote on a chemotherapy bill, Vukmir aligned with insurance companies that opposed the bill and was one of two state senators to vote no. That said, Vukmir’s vote wasn’t against oral chemotherapy. It was against stopping insurers from charging patients higher deductibles, copayments or coinsurance for oral chemotherapy than they would pay for traditional chemotherapy.

219,pomt-11917,"""In the eight years that I was mayor, (there was a) nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime, gang crime — crime went down because we grew our police department, we focused on constitutional community policing, we did some of the most innovative prevention, intervention, job re-entry programs in the nation.""",mostly true,/california/statements/2017/oct/18/antonio-villaraigosa/did-las-violent-crime-drop-nearly-half-during-vill/,"During his time as mayor of Los Angeles and now in his campaign for California governor, Antonio Villaraigosa has repeatedly highlighted the city’s drop in violent crime. Villaraigosa, one of the top Democrats vying to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018, spoke in detail in a late July interview on MSNBC about LA’s reduction in violent crime and the steps he claims led to that result. ""In the eight years that I was mayor, (there was a) nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime, gang crime — crime went down because we grew our police department, we focused on constitutional community policing, we did some of the most innovative prevention, intervention, job re-entry programs in the nation."" Villaraigosa makes his claim on MSNBC at about the 0:50 minute mark here. He made a similar claim on Capital Public Radio on October 4, 2017. ""When I was mayor of Los Angeles … we reduced our violent crime rate by 49 percent."" We wanted to know whether Villaraigosa’s claim about this big drop in violent crime stood up to the facts. We also wanted to know whether there was evidence supporting his explanation that growing the police force and focusing on community policing really led to the decline. We set out on a fact check. Our research To support the claim, Villaraigosa’s campaign pointed us to crime statistics and past news articles discussing the former mayor’s crime initiatives. We started by reviewing FBI crime data. Here’s what we found: According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics, the LAPD reported the violent crime rate per 100,000 people declined from 820.6 in 2005 -- the year Villaraigosa took office -- to 426 in 2013, the year he left office. That represents a 48 percent reduction in the violent crime rate, homicide, rape, robbery and assaults. That matches with his claim of a ""nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime"" made on MSNBC in late July. It also tracks with his more recent statement on Capital Public Radio. In addition to looking at the violent crime rate, we also reviewed the raw number of reported violent crimes over Villaraigosa’s tenure. That total was nearly cut in half from 31,767 in 2005 to 16,524 in 2013, LAPD statistics show. Beyond the numbers Charis Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California at Irvine, reviewed Villaraigosa’s claim at our request and told us ""the numbers do check out."" Kubrin added, however, that the more difficult challenge is determining how much of an impact Villaraigosa’s initiatives had on crime. ""It’s noteworthy that violent crime was going down well before 2005,"" Kubrin said. ""So there’s some question as to whether these are continuing trends or there’s something new about the time period he went into office."" For some perspective, violent crimes in LA dropped nearly 50 percent in the decade before Villaraigosa was elected mayor. They totaled nearly 73,000 in 1992 and had decreased to less than 38,000 by 2002. Who gets credit? Robert Stern, former president of the Los Angeles-based Center for Governmental Studies, said Villaraigosa should get some credit for his successful push to hire hundreds of new LAPD officers. But, Stern said, ""The main credit has to go to the police chief Bill Bratton. And also the fact that what we saw across the country was a reduction in crime in almost all the major cities. So, it was a trend that LA participated in. But I think the mayor can claim some credit at least for increasing the police force."" Violent crime rates fell by 50 percent nationwide from the early 1990s through 2015, according to an analysis of data compiled by the Pew Research Center. Looking at another large city, New York, during the specific period of Villaraigosa’s tenure, we found only a 7 percent decline in the violent crime rate. But looking at a broader period, from 1995 through 2013, New York saw a nearly 60 percent decline. Breaking from the long-term trend, California and the nation saw an increase in violent crime rates in 2016 and 2015, according to state and national figures. Criminologists credit factors from the economy to demographic changes to incarceration rates for driving crime trends nationally and in California. As mayor, Villaraigosa had limited influence over many of these factors. Kubrin said Villaraigosa’s expansion of the police force, by itself, was probably not the main driving force behind the crime reduction. Instead, she cited the strategy executed by the police as a more important element. The LAPD’s focus on community policing and crime prevention and intervention during Villaraigosa’s tenure likely helped reduce crime, Kubrin said. Researchers have found those police strategies are likely to reduce crime, the professor added, though their impact is limited. Praise from LAPD chief Villaraigosa’s campaign additionally pointed to praise from current LAPD Chief Charlie Beck in a 2013 Los Angeles Daily News article. Beck was paraphrased in the article as saying the violent crime drop during Villaraigosa’s tenure was ""unprecedented."" Beck ""attributed it largely to the outgoing mayor’s steadfast commitment — even during the Great Recession — to expand the LAPD during his tenure,"" the article said. Beck said the mayor’s public safety strategy was effective, the article continued, ""because it also included diverting at-risk youth from gangs; recruiting gang members to prevent conflicts between rival gangs from flaring up; and handing out grocery store gift cards in exchange for guns."" LAPD statistics on gang crime during Villaraigosa’s tenure were not immediately available. In his statement on MSNBC, the former mayor specifically cited gang crime as one category of violent crime that had dropped. News articles generally back up this statement. An investigation by VICE News in 2015, however, sheds light on a more nuanced change in LA gang crime in recent years. It found that while ""gang crime is down in the city, many experts cautioned that gangs haven't disappeared."" ""Gang members and gangs altogether have gone underground, pure and simple,"" Jorja Leap, a UCLA professor who researches gangs and criminal justice, told VICE News. She noted that social media has allowed gang members to retreat indoors, and that they have become more involved in lucrative illicit activities such as human trafficking. ""They have not disappeared but become more knowledgeable."" Our ruling Villaraigosa’s claim about a nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime during his time as LA mayor is backed up by LAPD crime statistics. His explanation for why this drop in crime took place is more difficult to evaluate. Experts we spoke with noted that violent crime had been falling well before Villaraigosa took office. They also said that key factors that drive crime trends, such as the economy, changing demographics and incarceration rates, are largely out of the control of a mayor. Villaraigosa’s statement does not include this context. Still, the mayor’s successful push to hire hundreds of new LAPD officers and focus on community policing is generally accepted as having, at the very least, some impact on reducing crime in the city. Additionally, the current LAPD chief has praised Villaraigosa's strategies for reducing gang violence, saying they helped reduce violent crime. We rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True.

220,pomt-13207,"""Because as a Senator Toomey stood up for Wall Street. He wanted to privatize Social Security and invest it in the stock market. Wall Street would make billions in fees even if the stock market crashed. """,mostly true,/pennsylvania/statements/2016/oct/21/afscme/story-behind-attack-ads-blast-pat-toomeys-plan-soc/,"Opponents of Senator Pat Toomey are making sure his past ideas about Social Security stay front and center. Social Security, of course, was a much hotter topic a few years ago. Many Republicans, including former President George W. Bush, pushed for allowing younger workers to contribute portions of payroll taxes into government-approved private mutual fund accounts. It was a movement for a partial privatization of Social Security. But that plan never gained much traction and lately politicians on both sides of the aisle have been reluctant to talk about privatizing Social Security and have instead focused on other means of reform or at least used less divisive terminology than ""privatization."" A recent ad from AFSCME throws Toomey into this mix. It accuses him of previously favoring the privatization of Social Security and, yes, uses the dreaded p-word: ""Because as a senator Toomey stood up for Wall Street. He wanted to privatize Social Security and invest it in the stock market. Wall Street would make billions in fees even if the stock market crashed."" We’ll break down this fact check into two parts: Toomey’s previous beliefs on Social Security privatization and then whether Wall Street would in fact make billions off such a plan. Ted Kwong, a spokesperson for Toomey, said over email Toomey once supported younger people placing portions of their payroll taxes into ""government-regulated private accounts."" (He did not answer a question about the Senator’s current position on Social Security privatization). This is backed up in several past interviews conducted with Toomey. Shortly after he was elected to the Senate, a New York Times article noted he intended ""to continue to push for allowing young people to invest part of their Social Security payroll tax."" Toomey told the Scranton Times-Tribune in 2010 workers on the verge of retirement would be guaranteed their current benefits. In his book, The Road to Prosperity, he laid out his beliefs in greater detail (Yes, Toomey has a book. It’s currently ranked 1,491,962 on Amazon’s top-seller list). Toomey wrote that older workers would continue to use the current Social Security system, ""But younger workers should be given a choice. Those who would prefer to stay in the current system should be allowed to do so….Others, however, should be free to deposit a portion of the payroll taxes they already pay into personal savings account instead of sending their hard-earned money to Washington."" In the book, Toomey gave an example of a beneficiary of this program as a young worker who could invest this portion of the payroll tax ""in a bundle of stocks and bonds"" and earn a much higher return than Social Security. In other words, he would want the worker to invest the money. That’s where Wall Street comes in. Right now, payroll tax for Social Security goes to a trust fund that is then invested into special securities overseen by the U.S. Treasury that are only available for the trust fund. Max Skidmore, author of The American System of Social Security: Separating Fact From Fallacy, said the administrative costs of this system are effectively nothing. They are less than one cent per dollar. That wouldn’t be the case with investments in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. If somebody were allowed to take a portion of their payroll tax that would normally go to Social Security and invest it, they would face much higher administrative fees. Skidmore said it would be difficult to estimate, but the total could easily reach the billions if many people were to opt for a personal account as proposed by Toomey and others. Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, said these fees would be comparable to what Americans see with their 401(k)’s, which have administrative fees. A University of Chicago study estimated if Social Security was partially privatized in one of the plans proposed by Bush fees paid to banks could be as high as $940 billion over 75 years. As for whether Toomey’s plan of letting only younger workers put a portion of their payroll tax into a personal account should still be considered privatization, Munnell said yes. ""When people were discussing this issue,"" she said, ""that is what was being discussed."" Our ruling A recent AFSCME ad claimed Pat Toomey supported Social Security privatization during his time as Senator: ""Because as a senator Toomey stood up for Wall Street. He wanted to privatize Social Security and invest it in the stock market. Wall Street would make billions in fees even if the stock market crashed."" In the past, PolitiFact has tried to emphasize the difference between privatization and partial privatization because Democratic and Republican politicians have tried to distort it. Toomey has not supported full privatization, which would mean completely overhauling the system so everyone’s proceeds of the payroll tax would go to personal accounts that could be privately invested. This ad doesn’t give the full picture. It doesn’t say he was for full privatization but also doesn’t make clear the difference between full and partial privatization. Toomey has supported partial privatization of Social Security. In the plan he wrote about -- and plans favored by past politicians -- young workers were expected to invest in stocks and mutual funds that are synonymous with Wall Street. The companies with whom people did their investing would earn sizable fees.

Liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow reviewed the numbers on her prime-time show on MSNBC: The news that the U.S. poverty rate is now the highest it has been since the early '90s, nearly one in six Americans now living in poverty. And the specifics are even worse: Child poverty rose from under 21 percent to 22 percent. Poverty among Hispanic Americans went from more than 25 percent to more than 26 percent. Poverty among African-Americans went from just under 26 percent to over 27 percent. Poverty among white people is much lower than those other groups but it is rising, too, and fast. It went up from 9.4 percent to 9.9 percent. The only large segment of the American population that serves as any sort of silver lining in these poverty numbers is older Americans. Poverty among Americans 65 and over is statistically unchanged, even as it is getting so much worse for so many other groups of people. And that, of course, is because we have something in this country that keeps older Americans out of poverty. It's called Social Security. And the fact that Social Security works, that it is keeping old people out of poverty in America, even as everybody else is slipping into it, the fact that it works means that in Republicanland, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination is someone who says that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and a failure. We wondered if Maddow was right that Social Security is the main factor keeping older Americans out of poverty. We suspected the federal program likely played some role, but we also wondered what role traditional pensions played. So we decided to check it out. A review of how Social Security works: Workers contribute to the program via payroll taxes. (Most people are required to participate, with a few exceptions, such as retirement programs for government employees like those in Galveston County, Texas.) When workers reach retirement age, they file for Social Security benefits. The government calculates their benefits according to a formula primarily based on average lifetime earnings, and sends them monthly checks. They'll get that amount, with small increases for inflation, until they die. Social Security has become a political topic lately because officials project the program won't take in enough money to pay full benefits starting around 2036. Most people agree the program will have to be changed to make it more financially solid. Getting back to our fact-check, Maddow is right that the poverty rate for Americans over age 65 is quite stable. For 2010, it was at 9 percent, up slightly from 8.9 percent in 2009, and lower than it was during the 1990s, when it reached a decade-high 12.9 percent in 1992. Next, we wanted to know how much Social Security made a difference to seniors with relatively low incomes: Quite a bit, it turns out. The Social Security Administration performs economic analysis and publishes research statistics for Americans over age 65. The latest research available is for 2008, but Melissa Favreault, an expert on Social Security with the Urban Institute, told us she didn't expect the percentages would be significantly different for 2010. The Social Security Administration looks at taxpayers aged 65 and older, dividing them up by income into five groups, from the lowest earning group to the highest. (For you non-policy wonks out there, these five groups are known as quintiles.) The numbers show that the less income people have, the more they depend on Social Security. Meanwhile, people who get pensions tend to be in the higher earning groups. Meanwhile, the Census Bureau stated in its recent report that Social Security was keeping millions of people out of poverty: ""In 2010, the number of people aged 65 and older in poverty would be higher by almost 14 million if Social Security payments were excluded from money income, quintupling the number of elderly people in poverty."" If you added 14 million additional seniors to those already in poverty in 2010, the poverty rate for American over age 65 would be 45 percent, not 9 percent. We also found a 2008 report on Social Security from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that analyzed ways to improve the future financing of Social Security. The report starts: ""Social Security has significantly reduced elderly poverty. The elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35% in 1959 to an all-time low of 9% in 2006, in large part because of Social Security. If Social Security benefits did not exist, an estimated 44% of the elderly would be poor today assuming no changes in behavior."" Still, there are a few other things to consider when evaluating Maddow's statement. Some seniors get public assistance from federal, state and local programs, particularly if they are poor or disabled. Those programs also have a role in keeping low-income seniors out of poverty. (Going back to the Social Security statistics that analyze quintiles, about 8 percent of the lowest quintile receives 50 percent or more of its income from public assistance.) Health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid could also indirectly increase people's income by paying for health care costs that they might otherwise pay out of pocket. Then there's the argument to be made that some Social Security beneficiaries would have saved the money on their own, in other more productive ways. We fact-checked Ed Schultz's statement on what poverty numbers might look like if Social Security had never existed, and looked in some detail at different scenarios. Finally, Social Security is not specifically aimed at keeping people out of poverty; many middle and upper-class people benefit as well. Social Security payments are based on people's lifetime earnings, so the more people earned during their working years, the more they get from Social Security. However, Social Security is progressive in the sense that low earners get more back in benefits than they contribute via payroll taxes. Andrew Biggs, an expert on Social Security with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that Social Security isn't particularly effective if looked at solely as an antipoverty program. ""In 2010, Social Security spent over $575 billion on retirement and survivors benefits, which comes to $14,675 for each person over age 65 –- enough to give every person a benefit that's 50 percent above the poverty line,"" said Biggs. ""And yet we still have 10 percent of seniors in poverty. If reducing poverty was our only goal, we could do a lot more while spending a lot less than we do."" In rating Maddow's statement, she's largely correct that Social Security keeps a significant number of older Americans out of poverty. But other programs also play a role.

222,pomt-12650,"""The vast majority of marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/23/barack-obama/obama-no-premium-hike-vast-majority-covered-govern/,"On the day House Republicans had scheduled a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, the man whose name became synonymous with the sweeping health care law touted its accomplishments. Marking the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama released a statement saying that after a century of talk, ""we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody."" ""Reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a ‘death spiral,’ because while it’s true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all,"" he wrote. We decided to vet the assertion that on average, the vast majority of people who signed up on a federal or state marketplaces saw no premium hike at all. Government numbers back that up, although the meaning of ""vast majority"" lies in the beholder. And it’s not as though premiums didn’t rise. They did, but most people purchasing health care through the marketplace didn’t feel it. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, about 12.2 million people signed up through a federal or state-based marketplace, also called an exchange. Of those, 7.8 million, about 64 percent, qualified for tax credits to reduce how much they personally would pay for coverage. Thanks to the tax credits, the average monthly bill for insurance stayed at $106 from 2016 to 2017, as the government chart below shows. The light blue represents the monthly premium paid by customers out-of-pocket. The darker blue represents the tax credit. ""Premiums went up, but a lot of people were protected from that,"" said Katherine Hempstead, director of health insurance coverage at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropy and research group based in New Jersey. The Congressional Budget Office underscored that dynamic in its most recent report on health care legislation. The analysts wrote that many people ""are largely insulated from increases in premiums because their out-of-pocket payments for premiums are based on a percentage of their income; the government pays the difference."" On average, premiums rose about 32 percent. The government data on the actual premiums people pay isn’t 100 percent complete. Details on about 3 million people who signed up through state-based exchanges are missing. But Hempstead said in the past, people in both groups had similar experiences. ""The only place you can get the subsidy is through the exchanges, so for both the federal and the state exchanges, most of the enrollment is from people who qualify for the subsidies,"" Hempstead said. It’s worth noting that as premiums rise, so does the price tag for Washington. The death spiral debate Obama was rebutting fears about a death spiral. That concern lies outside this fact-check, but we’ll summarize the arguments on both sides here. A death spiral takes place when costs rise so fast, healthy people begin opting to pay a tax penalty rather than pay for health care. With sicker people making up a larger percentage of those left in the health insurance pool, the average cost of care rises dramatically. White House press secretary Sean Spicer took on Obama’s statement during his daily press briefing. ""Enrollment is nowhere near expectations and this year is actually declining,"" Spicer said. ""Insurers are fleeing the exchanges, and one in three counties only has one insurer."" A 2016 summary from Mark Farrah Associates, a private analytic service, reported that insurers who left the exchanges cited ""significant losses on Marketplace business"" due in part to lower numbers of healthy enrollees. As for enrollment overall, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sign-ups fell by about 4 percent from 2016 to 2017. Outside analysts such as Hempstead say that’s not enough to spell trouble. ""Enrollments are largely holding steady,"" she said. ""There is no death spiral."" The Congressional Budget Office largely agreed. Comparing the Affordable Care Act with the Republican health care bill, the CBO wrote that ""the nongroup market would probably be stable in most areas under either current law or the legislation."" Our ruling Obama said that on average, the ""vast majority"" of people who have insurance through Obamacare experienced no premium increase. The actual numbers are that about 64 percent of enrollees saw their out-of-pocket premiums stay the same. So in terms of their personal experience, the former president is correct. However, premiums did rise. The reason many people didn’t feel it is because the government subsidies increased to insulate them. Obama was largely correct, but he brushed over the reality of rising premiums. We rate this claim Mostly True.

223,pomt-02363,"Russian annexation of Crimea ""removes a million residents of the Ukraine that have provided the margin of victory for (Viktor) Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow prime minister in his last election.""",mostly true,/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-crimea-annexation-removes-viktor-ya/,"We and our friends at PolitiFact are used to poring over American election results. Here, we’ll test our skills looking at election returns from Ukraine. We’re checking a claim by Karl Rove, a former top adviser to President George W. Bush, who appeared on the March 16, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday. Rove was discussing the Russian takeover of Crimea, suggesting that Russian-leaning candidates would now face long odds in Ukrainian politics without the votes of supporters on the Crimean peninsula. First, some background. Crimea which had long been a part of Russia until it was handed over in 1954 by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Crimea, despite the presence of Russian military facilities and a majority-Russian populace, remained part of the newly independent Ukraine. But earlier this month, protesters in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev ousted pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych. After a pro-western transitional government took power, Russia sent troops into Crimea -- located on the country’s southeast flank -- and scheduled a referendum to determine whether Crimea should affiliate with Russia. In the March 16 referendum, which was criticized by the West as illegal, roughly 97 percent of Crimean voters sided with secession to Russia. Within two days, Russian president Vladimir Putin had formally accepted Crimea into Russia by signing an annexation treaty. While this treaty still needs to pass through a few more hoops to take effect, these are considered formalities. On Fox News Sunday, Rove operated under the assumption that annexation would go forward. Annexation, Rove said, ""removes a million residents of the Ukraine that have provided the margin of victory for Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow prime minister in his last election."" Such a change to the map would mean that the remainder of Ukraine, following the removal of one of its strongest pro-Russia bastions, would become more favorable electoral territory for pro-Ukrainian politicians. In the United States, it might be analogous to gains the Democratic Party could make if Texas were to secede from the union, or gains the GOP could make if California were to quit the United States. We wondered whether what Rove said was accurate, so we looked through Ukrainian election results from the 2010 presidential election. In that election, the second and final round of voting pitted Yanukovych against pro-Ukraine politician Yulia Tymoshenko. In the final balloting, Yanukovych defeated Tymoshenko 49 percent to 46 percent. In order for Rove to be correct, Yanukovych’s margin of victory over Tymoshenko in Crimea and Sevastopol -- the two regions that joined Russia -- would have to match or exceed his margin of victory in the nation as a whole. It turns out that Rove’s claim was close, but not perfect. In Crimea, Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko by a 639,529-vote margin, and in Sevastopol, he won by a 156,261-vote margin. Together, that equals a margin of 795,790. Nationally, though, Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko by a somewhat larger margin -- 887,909 votes. So Yanukovych’s margin in Crimea and Sevastopol didn’t account for all of his national margin of victory, but it came close -- about 90 percent of the vote. Dominique Arel, who chairs the Ukrainian studies department at the University of Ottawa, said that ""47 percent of the electorate lives in the southeast. With the removal of Crimea, it probably shrinks to 45 percent or a touch less, making it very difficult in a polarized election for a southeast candidate to win."" A final note: Other regions provided even more votes for Yanukovych than Crimea and Sevastopol did. Donetsk provided him with a margin of more than 2.2 million votes, while Luhansk gave him a margin of more than 1.1 million votes. Our ruling Rove said that Russian annexation of Crimea ""removes a million residents of the Ukraine that have provided the margin of victory for (Viktor) Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow prime minister in his last election."" Crimea and neighboring Sevastopol -- the two newly annexed portions of Russia -- were certainly bastions of support for Yanukovych in the 2010 election. But while they came close to providing his entire national margin of victory, they fell a bit short, providing 90 percent of Yanukovych’s winning margin.

224,pomt-12708,"The GOP health care plan gives ""$275 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people earning $250,000 a year or more.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/09/bernie-sanders/sanders-gop-health-care-plan-gives-wealthiest-275-/,"Sen Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., put a different spin on the Republican House’s plan to overhaul the health care system. Speaking on MSNBC, Sanders said the House plan isn’t really a health care plan at all. It’s a tax cut package, he says, that overwhelmingly helps the wealthy. ""Look at it as a tax plan with $275 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people earning $250,000 a year or more,"" Sanders said on All In With Chris Hayes March 8. He said the change amounted to a transfer of wealth from working families to the wealthiest. Is that true? Sanders’ office told us they got their tax numbers from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional committee that lawmakers rely on for core fiscal data. The committee estimated the impact of repealing two taxes on the wealthy in the Affordable Care Act. One is a 0.9 percent payroll tax on earnings and the other is a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income for individuals with incomes over $200,000 and couples with incomes over $250,000. In the decade between 2017 and 2026, the committee said dropping both measures would cut taxes by $274.9 billion. The Tax Policy Center, a joint fiscal analysis project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, confirmed Sanders’ number for the total tax cut. Two caveats First, Sanders’ fixation on the top 2 percent is not quite right. According to the latest survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, households making $250,000 and above accounted for the top 4.4 percent. Sanders’ office cited an op-ed from two advocacy groups that asserted that those making that much fell into the top 2 percent. Second, Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, said Sanders left out a couple of ""nuances."" The House Republican plan includes other forms of tax relief that will benefit a broader swath of Americans. ""Repealing ACA taxes delivers small tax cuts to most people throughout the income distribution,"" Mermin said. Plus, he added, removing the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance would benefit people regardless of income, though for low and moderate income families, ""the overall average impact is small,"" Mermin said. Our ruling Sanders said that the Republican House health care plan would cut taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent by $275 billion. While Sanders didn’t specify the time frame, that is a 10-year estimate from a neutral congressional committee. Estimates that look a decade ahead are typical in budgeting circles. The one point where Sanders erred most was in labeling the affected taxpayers as the ""top 2 percent."" According to government data, a more accurate number is 4.4 percent. But that’s still a small sliver of the population. We rate this claim Mostly True.

225,pomt-05290,"Says Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history,"" because it's actually risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/23/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-post-says-barack-obama-has-lowest-s/,"EDITOR'S NOTE: This item prompted a large volume and feedback and comments. We published an article about the comments on May 25 and an update to this item on May 31. You'll find the update below, at the end of the fact-check. On May 22, 2012, Rex Nutting, the international commentary editor for the financial website MarketWatch, published a column titled, ""Obama spending binge never happened."" Nutting’s column explored data on federal spending patterns during recent presidencies, concluding that -- contrary to the tax-and-spend stereotype of Democrats -- President Barack Obama has actually presided over the smallest increases in federal spending of any recent president. The column went viral. Within hours, people who liked the column were posting a graphic on Facebook that paired a line from Nutting’s column with a quote from Mitt Romney’s campaign website. Under the heading, ""Romney’s World,"" the Facebook post quoted a Romney Web page saying, ""Since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history."" (That accurately quotes Romney.) Immediately to the right, under the heading, ""Real World,"" the Facebook post provided a retort using a caption from Nutting’s key chart: ""Government spending under Obama, including his signature stimulus bill, is rising at a 1.4 percent annualized pace — slower than at any time in nearly 60 years."" (The post cited the quotation to the Wall Street Journal; technically, Nutting writes for MarketWatch, which is an affiliate of the Wall Street Journal.) The Facebook post appears to have originated with the liberal blog Groobiecat Call, which promises ""data-driven analysis"" and ""lefteous indignation."" Before the day was out, roughly a dozen PolitiFact readers had forwarded it to us, seeking our view of its accuracy. So we looked into it. Nutting’s column First, let’s recap what Nutting said in his column: ""Almost everyone believes that Obama has presided over a massive increase in federal spending, an ‘inferno’ of spending that threatens our jobs, our businesses and our children’s future. Even Democrats seem to think it’s true. But it didn’t happen. Although there was a big stimulus bill under Obama, federal spending is rising at the slowest pace since Dwight Eisenhower brought the Korean War to an end in the 1950s."" Nutting ran the numbers for the past 60 years, adjusting for the fact that ""the first year of every presidential term starts with a budget approved by the previous administration and Congress."" For Obama, that means that ""the 2009 fiscal year, which Republicans count as part of Obama’s legacy, began four months before Obama moved into the White House. The major spending decisions in the 2009 fiscal year were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress."" He continued, ""By no means did Obama try to reverse that spending. Indeed, his budget proposals called for even more spending in subsequent years. But the Congress (mostly Republicans but many Democrats, too) stopped him. If Obama had been a king who could impose his will, perhaps what the Republicans are saying about an Obama spending binge would be accurate."" Nutting did, however, attribute a portion of fiscal 2009 spending to Obama rather than Bush. He reassigned about $140 billion, covering spending made that year through the stimulus bill, the expansion of a children’s health-care program and other appropriations bills passed in the spring of 2009. ""If we attribute that $140 billion in stimulus to Obama and not to Bush,"" Nutting wrote, ""we find that spending under Obama grew by about $200 billion over four years, amounting to a 1.4 percent annualized increase."" Our analysis Before presenting our own calculations, we’ll get some methodological issues out of the way. Like Nutting, we used historical data from the Office of Management and Budget along with projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Projecting outlays into the future involves a degree of uncertainty, but CBO’s most recent projections are considered the most independent and reliable. Because we’re checking the Facebook post rather than Nutting’s column, we examined the way the post compared the presidents. Since the Facebook post ignores differences between presidents’ first and second terms, which are noted in Nutting’s chart, we’ve combined presidents’ entire tenures into a single time span. And several presidents who served during the past 60 years didn’t have tenures that coincided precisely with fiscal years, due to assassination or resignation. So we’re using the closest fiscal years we can, and we’re skipping President Gerald Ford, whose tenure was too short to adequately measure. Here are the average spending increases per year in raw dollars (not adjusted for inflation) in descending order by president: President Fiscal year baseline Last fiscal year Average percentage increase per year Carter 1977 1981 16.4 Nixon 1969 1975 13.5 Johnson 1964 1969 11.0 George W. Bush 2001 2009 10.2 Reagan 1981 1989 8.6 Kennedy 1961 1964 7.1 George H.W. Bush 1989 1993 5.8 Clinton 1993 2001 4.0 Eisenhower 1953 1961 3.6 Obama 2009 2013 1.4 So, using raw dollars, Obama did oversee the lowest annual increases in spending of any president in 60 years. Here are the results using inflation-adjusted figures: President Fiscal year baseline Last fiscal year Average percentage increase per year Johnson 1964 1969 6.3 George W. Bush 2001 2009 5.9 Kennedy 1961 1964 4.7 Carter 1977 1981 4.2 Nixon 1969 1975 3.0 Reagan 1981 1989 2.7 George H.W. Bush 1989 1993 1.8 Clinton 1993 2001 1.5 Obama 2009 2013 -0.1 Eisenhower 1953 1961 -0.5 So, using inflation-adjusted dollars, Obama had the second-lowest increase -- in fact, he actually presided over a decrease once inflation is taken into account. Bottom line: The Facebook post’s claim that government spending under Obama is ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years"" is very close to accurate. Explaining the results So why the disconnect between Obama’s image as a big spender and the reality of how much federal spending has actually grown? First, Obama’s record on debt is a lot less flattering than is his record on federal government spending. During the same time that spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year. The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven’t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there’s an annual deficit, the national debt grows. Second, federal spending under Obama is higher as a share of gross domestic product than it has been in most of the previous 60 years. That, too is because of the economy, which has simultaneously slowed the growth of GDP and boosted government spending for programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. Third, the aging of the baby boomers has driven a rise in entitlement spending that is masking cuts Obama and the GOP Congress have made, and have promised to make, in discretionary spending. Using outlays as the unit of measurement, as Nutting and the Facebook post have done, means focusing on money already spent. It does not take into account future spending that’s been committed to but not yet carried out. And finally, many Americans associate Obama with the high-profile legislative activities of his first year or two, when initiatives such as the stimulus sent spending upward the fastest. Since then, spending has slowed, thanks in part to spending cuts pushed by congressional Republicans. Which brings us to another important issue: The president is not all-powerful, so his record on spending was accomplished in collaboration with congressional Republicans. Our ruling The Facebook post says Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history,"" because it's actually risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years."" Obama has indeed presided over the slowest growth in spending of any president using raw dollars, and it was the second-slowest if you adjust for inflation. The math simultaneously backs up Nutting’s calculations and demolishes Romney’s contention. The only significant shortcoming of the graphic is that it fails to note that some of the restraint in spending was fueled by demands from congressional Republicans. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. UPDATE, May 31, 2012 While we have already shared some of the critiques of this fact-check in a previous follow-up story, critics have since noted that two of our fellow fact checkers -- the Washington Post Fact Checker and the Associated Press -- offered more negative rulings on related claims. The Fact Checker addressed the apparent discrepancy succinctly in a follow-up column, saying ""we did not evaluate the same thing."" There’s a widespread misconception that we gave a Mostly True rating to Rex Nutting’s MarketWatch column. After our original fact-check published, White House spokesman Jay Carney tweeted, ""PolitiFact backs MarketWatch analysis of federal spending under POTUS & predecessors."" Many conservative bloggers read our fact-check the same way, as they attacked us. The assumption made by both sides is wrong. We examined at a Facebook post that said Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history,"" because it's actually risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years."" The Facebook post does rely partly on Nutting’s work, and our item addresses that, but we did not simply give our seal of approval to everything Nutting wrote. In fact, half of the Facebook post stems from something else entirely -- a claim on Mitt Romney’s website. Using and slightly tweaking Nutting’s methodology, we recalculated spending increases under each president back to Dwight Eisenhower and produced tables ranking the presidents from highest spenders to lowest spenders. By contrast, both the Fact Checker and the AP zeroed in on one narrower (and admittedly crucial) data point -- how to divide the responsibility between George W. Bush and Obama for the spending that occurred in fiscal year 2009, when spending rose fastest. How you divide the spending between Bush and Obama for fiscal 2009 only makes a difference to our ruling if the shifts move Obama significantly up or down our rankings. Do they? Nutting attributed spending from the first year of every presidential term to the previous administration, arguing that every new president starts their term four months into a fiscal year begun under their predecessor. Historically, this has not been a particularly controversial approach, and even some of Nutting’s critics we spoke to agreed that it’s not a bad rule of thumb. But fiscal year 2009 was special because it came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation’s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. Nutting did take these factors into account, but not to the extent that some critics think is needed. Nutting shifted $140 billion in fiscal 2009 spending from two of Obama’s signature programs -- the economic stimulus package and an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program -- out of Bush’s column and into Obama’s. He also shifted excess spending beyond what Bush would have spent from the appropriations bills signed by Obama in 2009. A number of critics also argued that spending for the Troubled Asset Relief Program should be taken into account. This program aided troubled financial institutions and involved a lot of money going out the door in fiscal 2009 and a lot of money coming in the door in subsequent years as the money was paid back to the treasury. The critics note that counting the TARP expenses as Bush’s artificially raises the baseline level of spending Obama inherited, thereby making Obama’s subsequent spending increases seem unrealistically small. We think reasonable people can disagree on which president should be responsible for TARP spending, but to give the critics their say, we’ll include it in our alternative calculation. So, combining the fiscal 2009 costs for programs that are either clearly or arguably Obama’s -- the stimulus, the CHIP expansion, the incremental increase in appropriations over Bush’s level and TARP -- produces a shift from Bush to Obama of between $307 billion and $456 billion, based on the most reasonable estimates we’ve seen critics offer. That’s quite a bit larger than Nutting’s $140 billion, but by our calculations, it would only raise Obama’s average annual spending increase from 1.4 percent to somewhere between 3.4 percent and 4.9 percent. That would place Obama either second from the bottom or third from the bottom out of the 10 presidents we rated, rather than last. When we encounter a compound claim such as this one, we consider the accuracy of each part separately. During our internal discussions, we give a preliminary rating to each half of a claim, then average them to produce our final, published rating. Our extensive consultations with budget analysts since our item was published convinces us that there’s no single ""correct"" way to divvy up fiscal 2009 spending, only a variety of plausible calculations. So the second portion of the Facebook claim -- that Obama’s spending has risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years"" -- strikes us as Half True. Meanwhile, we would’ve given a True rating to the Facebook claim that Romney is wrong to say that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history.""

226,pomt-14815,"""The actual (construction) contracts that we’ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates.""",mostly true,/california/statements/2015/nov/24/jeff-morales/have-construction-costs-dropped-several-hundred-mi/,"LISTEN TO THIS STORY: California’s high-speed rail plan is perhaps best known for its sky-high cost estimates, which at one point spiked to $98 billion. The project’s budget was subsequently cut to $68 billion -- still well above the state’s $33 billion price tag in 2008, when voters approved bond funding for the rail network. But questions about cost overruns continue to dog the California High-Speed Rail Authority. A consultant’s draft report was recently made public and indicated the system’s Merced-to-Burbank stretch could cost $8 billion more than expected. Rail authority officials said the report was preliminary, and hasn’t increased the current budget. In recent weeks, Jeff Morales, the rail authority’s chief executive officer, and other authority leaders, have tried to change the narrative about mounting costs. They’ve started to say that expenses are, in fact, trending down. ""The actual (construction) contracts that we’ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates. That’s the reality of where we are in the program,"" Morales said during a press conference in Madera in late October, captured in the video clip below. KSEE TV Fresno, Nov. 1, 2015 Several hundred million dollars is miniscule compared with the project’s overall cost. But because the CEO’s statement goes against the project’s past financial history, it inspired us to check the facts. Checking Morales’ claim Rail authority officials clarified that Morales was referring to the project’s first two major construction contracts. We dug out those documents for a look. The first is for a 29-mile stretch of track from Madera to Fresno, including a tunnel and several raised crossings, one over the San Joaquin River. The authority’s lowest cost estimate was $1.2 billion. The winning bid was significantly less, at about $1 billion. The authority’s second major project is a 60-mile leg from Fresno south to the Tulare-Kern County line. It projected the price as low as $1.5 billion. The winning bid was a slightly more than $1.2 billion. Doing the math, the bids were a combined $480 million less than the lowest estimates. That qualifies as ""several hundred million dollars."" Morales, the rail authority executive, doesn’t call this a ‘savings’ in his statement. He says only that bids came in below estimates, which the authority set for itself. On the right track? These bids are significantly less than estimated. But is that the end of the story? And does this mean the rail authority will see a cost savings? Not likely, said Jan Whittington, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the financing of large-scale infrastructure projects across the globe. That’s because there are always unforeseen consequences. Crews could hit harder rock than anticipated, find an endangered species along the route or encounter unstable soil, all adding to the time and cost of the project. ""There’s always going to be something that either the project manager or the contractors themselves did not foresee in design that they encounter during construction,"" Whittington said. ""It’s nice to hear that they received bids that were lower than anticipated. But you don’t know how much it costs until they finish constructing it and it’s begun operating."" Still in the hole Steve Boilard, who heads Sacramento State University’s Center for California Studies, said any implication that lower construction bids lead to actual savings is wrong. He said these lower bids do little to remove the bullet train’s overall financial uncertainty. The authority lacks funds for the bulk of the project, which would link the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas. ""With an overall cost of $68 billion, it just means that the hole that we’re in and having to find money, maybe is going to be a little bit less as a result of these lower bids,"" Boilard said. Morales isn’t the only rail authority leader to tout the low bids. Dan Richard, the authority’s chairman, recently told Capital Public Radio that that ""costs are coming down"" for much of the system, in part, due to the bids. In a follow up interview, Richard explained that the authority is using design-build agreements that shift some cost overruns to the construction contractor. He said, however, there is no way for the authority to completely avoid unexpected, added expenses. Our ruling Jeff Morales, the rail authority’s chief executive officer, said in late October: ""The actual (construction) contracts that we’ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates."" After digging out the original documents, the winning bids are a combined $480 million below the authority’s cost estimates. That works out to ""several hundred"" million. Still, the lower bids do nothing to wipe away the overall project’s financial uncertainty, several experts said. Its funding gap remains in the tens of billions of dollars. The implication behind Morales’ statement about the bids is that the authority is either controlling its costs or could potentially save money. Officials probably wouldn’t talk about the bids otherwise. Even the authority’s chairman said there’s no way to safeguard against all possible higher expenses. The phrase ""to date"" in the CEO’s carefully worded comment may be the most critical going forward. Every independent expert we spoke with suggested future cost overruns are likely for the project.

The West Virginia Republican Party touted gains in manufacturing employment in a tweet on Aug. 7.

See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To support its assertion, the state party tweeted a link to a CNBC article that included that text verbatim. How accurate are those numbers? They check out. Between the months of July 2017-July 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a gain of 327,000 jobs in manufacturing, just as the CNBC article said. We looked at the previous July-to-July gains or losses in manufacturing jobs going back to 1994-95 and found that the 2018 performance was easily the best during that period. Here are the results: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We also confirmed that from April 1994 to April 1995, the economy gained 345,000 manufacturing jobs. The intervening periods -- May 1994 to May 1995, and June 1994 to June 1994 -- both fell short of 345,000. We’ll note that manufacturing jobs are only slowly recovering the ground they have lost since the 1980s, and especially after the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009. Here’s the long view of manufacturing employment in the United States: To the extent that manufacturing employment has been increasing, it’s been doing so at a fairly steady -- if modest -- rate since 2010, including more than six years on President Barack Obama’s watch. In addition, while the tweet gave Trump and Republicans credit for the recent gain, economists say presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles.

228,pomt-07592,"Says ""legislation pending in the House would effectively limit or eliminate ‘time-and-a-half’ for people who work overtime.""",mostly true,/ohio/statements/2011/mar/25/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-pending-legislation-w/,"Ohio House Democratic Leader Armond Budish has vowed to ""fight like hell"" against the plan to narrow public workers’ collective bargaining rights, known as Senate Bill 5. Behind the tough talk is a strategy to enlist more than the union workers who have become the face of the SB 5 opposition. Budish and Democrats want all middle-class, working Ohioans to join the fight. Budish’s message to recruits: Republicans are engaged in a full-scale war against the middle class. The Beachwood Democrat issued a warning in a letter to The Plain Dealer published March 17. ""For example, legislation pending in the House would effectively limit or eliminate ‘time-and-a-half’ for people who work overtime."" Budish’s claim piqued PolitiFact Ohio’s interest because time-and-a-half has been a standard pay scale for overtime work for decades. The legislation Budish referenced is House Bill 61, which two Republicans introduced in January. A House committee recommended the bill for approval earlier this month, although all Democrats on the committee voted against it. The bill has not been up for a full floor vote yet. The pending legislation would allow certain workers to receive one hour of compensatory time – paid time off – rather than overtime wages for each hour worked exceeding 40 in a week. Federal and state labor laws require most employers pay time-and-a-half for overtime. HB 61 would allow workers to accumulate up to 240 hours of comp time. At the end of a year, employers would have to pay overtime wages for any unused comp time. There are two key issues in Budish’s claim. Does the bill allow employers to abuse their authority and force workers to take comp time instead of overtime wages? How many Ohio workers would HB 61 affect? Let’s start with the second issue. HB61 would cover private employers (with some exceptions) with annual gross sales between $150,000 and $500,000, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission. About 10,000 members of the Ohio chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business have self-reported gross receipts between $100,000 and $500,000, said Chris Ferruso, legislative director for the organization. Businesses with sales above $500,000 already must comply with federal overtime laws. ""A lot of this is aimed at very small businesses,"" said Tony Seegers, director of Labor and Human Resources Policy for the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. ""It’s not going to be a lot of employers, but it’s going to be some of the smaller ones."" The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio NFIB support HB 61. As for the first issue, HB 61 supporters note that workers would get to chose between comp time and overtime pay. The bill says employers cannot require workers to take comp time. And workers are supposed to initiate the exchange for comp time. The bill also bars employers from threatening, intimidating or firing workers who want overtime wages. Columbus attorney Fred Gittes called the voluntary nature of the bill ""a charade."" Gittes’ argument speaks to the core of Budish’s claim that the bill ""would effectively limit or eliminate"" time-and-a-half pay for overtime work. Gittes argues that employers could force their workers to take comp time instead of overtime because the bill lacks teeth to discourage the from doing so. He testified against the bill on behalf of the Ohio Employment Lawyers Association. Employers would have a financial motivation to press workers to take comp time. Comp time would be awarded on a one-to-one ratio for extra hours worked. An employee who worked two extra hours, for example, would get two hours of comp time. That’s a cheaper arrangement than paying time-and-a-half for each overtime hour worked. Gittes argues that the penalties are too weak for employers who break the rules. The bill has no provisions to help a worker get his job back or to recover lost wages. Instead, employers who force workers to take comp time would be fined double the worker’s hourly wage for the number of comp time hours involved in the violation, plus attorney fees and court costs. Federal overtime laws include employer penalties that allow a worker to regain their job and wages lost from the time of their firing. Gittes said he has discussed with the bill’s sponsors the inclusion of such language, but it has not been added. The monetary difference resulting from stiffer penalties could be vast. Take, for example, the case of a worker with a $10 per hour wage who was fired for refusing to accept 200 hours in comp time. If the worker prevailed in court, under HB 61, he would be awarded about $4,000. If the same worker won a lawsuit under federal labor laws, he could win his job back and wages covering those that were lost from the point of termination. ""What employer will continue to pay time-and-a-half for each hour of overtime if they can effectively force employees to agree to take comp time at their normal rate of pay?"" Gittes said in his testimony to the House Small Business and Economic Development Committee. So where does Budish’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter? Budish is correct that the bill would provide a means to limit time-and-a-half pay. And while Gittes’ conclusion is tinged with cynicism, unscrupulous businesses do exist. But voluntary choices made by employees also could limit time-and-a-half. Budish’s statement simply describes the affected group as people who work overtime, but the changes in HB 61 would only have an impact on smaller businesses.

229,pomt-06592,"""The water quality in the ocean is perfect. It’s been tested up and down every ocean shore in New Jersey.""",mostly true,/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/25/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-jersey-shore-water-quality/,"There’s a strip of coastline in the United States where the quality of the water is better than good, according to the governor. ""The water quality in the ocean is perfect,"" Gov. Chris Christie said during a Sept. 2 press conference at Point Pleasant Beach, days after Hurricane Irene blasted through. ""It’s been tested up and down every ocean shore in New Jersey."" PolitiFact New Jersey found that while test results show the water is the best it’s been in years, some environmental experts disagree with Christie’s assessment. First, let’s look at how New Jersey reviews water quality. The state Department of Environmental Protection, in collaboration with local health departments, tests the water from Sandy Hook to Cape May each week from mid-May to mid-September, according to department spokesman Larry Ragonese. Water samples from swimming areas are tested for fecal coliform and other types of bacteria connected with sewage, stormwater runoff, and other pollutants, he said. The results, Ragonese said, have come back clean consistently since at least 2006, ranking Jersey shore waters above the 99th percentile of cleanliness on a scale of 100 percent. ""There’s really been a concerted effort to really, really stress the importance of clean beaches,"" Ragonese said. In fact, New Jersey ranked second in the nation, behind New Hampshire, for ocean water quality in 2010, according to a June report by the National Resources Defense Council. The weekly tests check the levels of enterococcus, a bacteria normally found in the feces of people and many animals. Any level above 104 enterococci per 100 milliliters of sample is considered too high, according to state standards. PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed test results for beaches in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties dating to 2005. We found that in most cases, water quality results have been their best since 2008, with the level of enterococci well below the state’s threshold. If a test sample exceeds acceptable bacteria levels twice, the beach is closed until the bacteria level falls into normal range, Ragonese said. Jill Lipoti, director of the Division of Water Monitoring and Standards for the DEP, said three beaches were closed all along the shore this summer. Still, three environmental groups challenged Christie’s claim of ""perfect"" water quality. Trenton-based Environment New Jersey pointed to low oxygen levels in the ocean and questioned the health of the water for marine life. Pollution in Barnegat Bay and beach closures due to pollution also are a concern, said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey. ""I think the governor does a disservice to citizens in the state when he makes statements like that,"" Jaborska said. ""There are lots of issues with the ocean."" Larry Levine, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York City, also said the Jersey shore’s water quality is not perfect. ""Every coastal state has some degree of issues with water pollution at beaches,"" in part due to stormwater runoff from urban and suburban areas where raw sewage and overflow can combine in the same pipe en route to a sewage treatment plant, Levine explained. When heavy rains are more than the treatment plants can handle, an untreated mixture of sewage and runoff can be released into waterways that lead to the coast. ""That’s an issue nationwide, not just in New Jersey,"" Levine said. Clean Ocean Action of Monmouth County also wouldn’t qualify the water as perfect, but credited New Jersey for taking steps toward improvement. ""The ocean’s much better off than it has been in a decade and while some individual pollutants may still be low, we have taken in this state with the Legislature and the governor’s office many impressive first steps that are long overdue,"" said Sean Dixon, coastal policy attorney for Clean Ocean Action. ""There’s always more to be done."" Our ruling Encouraging people to return to the Jersey shore, Christie claimed the water quality is ""perfect,"" and that frequent test results have been favorable up and down the coast. While test results show that the shore’s waters are better than in past years, some environmental organizations disagree with the governor’s assessment. We rate this claim Mostly True.

230,pomt-12486,"Poor people pay ""in some cases, up to 25 percent of (their) income for water.""",mostly true,/global-news/statements/2017/may/01/matt-damon/matt-damon-some-pay-25-their-income-water/,"Hollywood star Matt Damon has been a champion of bringing clean water and sanitation to the world’s poor for many years, co-founding the group Water.org. The organization links families to microloans so they can tap into safe water supplies. In a conversation with the president of the World Bank, Damon tried to convey a sense of the severity of the problem. ""The poor often pay more for water than the middle class,"" Damon said. ""These people have no savings, but they’re paying every day, in some cases, up to 25 percent of their income just for water."" People who live in poverty always spend most if not every penny of what little they earn on basic necessities. That is part of the crushing reality of being poor. But we wanted to know about the fraction of their income that goes toward water. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rosemary Gudelj, spokeswoman for Water.org, told us the statistic was based somewhat on anecdotal evidence. Gudelj said Damon drew on the work of the group’s co-founder Gary White. ""Gary’s statement has been, ‘I have met people who pay up to 25 percent of their income on water,’ "" Gudelj said. ""This comes from Gary’s experience in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, when doing research for his master’s thesis."" That might not seem like much to hang a claim on, but we did find a 2006 United Nations Development Program estimate that confirmed Damon’s point. ""In Uganda water payments represent as much as 22 percent of the average income of urban households in the poorest 20 percent of the income distribution,"" the report said. The report went on to say that in countries such as Argentina, El Salvador and Jamaica, the bottom fifth of households were spending over 10 percent of their money on water. The core problem, the report said, is the poorest families often pay the highest prices for water because they aren’t connected to the pipes that provide service to middle class and wealthy homes: ""In Jakarta, Lima, Manila and Nairobi households living in slums and low-­income settlements typically pay 5–10 times or more for their water than high-income residents of the same city. In Manila an estimated 4 million people receive water resold through kiosks, pushcart vendors or tanker deliveries."" Each of those middlemen take their cut, and the cost of water rises accordingly. Now, that United Nations report is a decade old and progress has been made since. But Damon avoided hard numbers and the risk that some would be outdated. Taken at face value, he only said that some people pay as much as 25 percent of their income on water. To know the reality, the gold standard would be household spending surveys from a range of countries. But it looks like current ones for water expenditures don’t exist. A report from the advocacy group WaterAid used a baseline assumption that someone was buying the 50 liters/day minimum for drinking water and and sanitation set by the World Health Organization in compiling hypothetical water bills for many countries. But Michael Hanemann, an economist who specializes in water at the University of California Berkeley, said that’s a dicey set of calculations. ""In economics it is the case that when something is expensive, people buy less of it,"" he told PolitiFact. ""It is more likely that they are getting by with less water."" Or as likely, they are using unclean water, and paying the price with illness and bad health. By the way, the average water and sewer bill in the United States is about 0.5 percent of household income, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Our ruling Damon said that poor people sometimes pay as much as 25 percent of their income for water. A decade-old United Nations report said that the urban poor in Uganda were paying very nearly that much, about 22 percent of their wages. Damon’s co-founder of Water.org has seen people spending this much in his work in Honduras. More recent hard data appears to be in short supply. But it wouldn’t take much for Damon’s claim to be accurate. Given that poor people pay an inordinate share of whatever money they have for basic needs, and they tend to live in places where water costs more, some people probably do spend as much as Damon said. The facts we have are enough for us to rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com",None,Matt Damon,None,None,None,2017-05-01T18:04:20,2017-04-20,['None']

But Occupy Wall Street isn't your typical protest action. The group has no list of demands, and it says it has no leaders. Rather, people are organizing through social media and making decisions by consensus. Protesters say they're following the model of Egyptian protesters and others who were part of the Arab Spring. An Occupy Wall Street website proclaims, ""This site has nothing to do with us."" But it also states the one thing protesters have in common: ""We are the 99% that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1%."" Independent filmmaker Michael Moore recently spoke to protesters in Lower Manhattan, and then discussed the movement on Amy Goodman's Democracy Now radio show. She asked Moore what he thought of police arrests of the protesters. Here's what Moore had to say: ""Well, it's highly ironic that now over 100 of the protesters have been arrested and not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America — nobody, not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008. Who created schemes, financial schemes that not only destroyed the economy, but took away the future of this generation, of this young man and his children in the future. They have completely ruined it for people while they have become filthy rich. Not one of them arrested, but 100 of these people who have stood up non-violently against this madness, and they're arrested? This just boggles the mind."" We read the same sentiment repeated on Twitter from people supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement's protests. We've noticed news reports before that have noted a general lack of prosecutions. But we wanted to know if Moore and others were right that not a single banker or corporate executive had been arrested. So we decided to check it out. To summarize our findings, we found a few prosecutions, but not many. And we wouldn't describe the targets as the people who were responsible for bringing down the economy. The most notable prosecutions If you're looking for arrests and prosecutions against executives associated with the biggest banks, you won't find them. And we found no arrests of execs with the firms most widely associated with the financial crisis such as Countrywide, AIG or Lehman Brothers. The highest-profile convictions we found were from Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, which was a mortgage lending firm based not on Wall Street, but in Ocala, Fla. Its former chairman, Lee B. Farkas, was convicted of directing nearly $3 billion in fraud that put thousands out of work and contributed to the collapse of Colonial Bank. The collapse was the sixth-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. A judge sentenced Farkas to 30 years in prison on June 30, 2011. Several other executives associated with the firm pleaded guilty in related cases. There were also criminal charges brought against two hedge fund managers at Bear Stearns, who were accused of lying to investors and put on trial for securities fraud. But a jury acquitted them in 2009, and the two men were mid-level managers, not top executives. There have been many other prosecutions of mortgage fraud and insider trading. The U.S. Justice Department pointed us to its StopFraud.gov website, and sent us a long list of other ongoing actions against mortgage fraud, investment fraud, insider trading and other corporate offenses. But the cases have not involved the highly prominent executives Moore described as bringing down the U.S. economy. (We contacted Moore for comment but did not hear back.) Why not more prosecutions? In reviewing the research and talking to experts about why there have not been more prosecutions associated with the financial crisis, we found several reasons. For one thing, such cases tend to be difficult, and it's not immediately clear what offenses executives could be charged with. ""You can't get up in front of a jury and say, 'These guys were responsible for bringing down the economy, so please convict them of a crime,'"" said Samuel Buell, a professor of law at Duke University, who studies criminal law and the regulation of corporations and financial markets. Criminal intent can be particularly hard to prove, and federal officials may be struggling to bring specific charges against individuals who believed they were following the law. Buell dismissed the idea that the Obama administration is simply indifferent to corporate crime. ""There's no downside to putting a few people in prison and showing you're tough on corporate crime,"" he said. ""You can only imagine that would be a political benefit to this administration, which makes me think the only thing holding them back is problems of proof. The last thing they would want to do is bring a big, splashy case against the banks, and then lose and be called incompetent."" William Black, a professor of law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law who studies elite financial fraud, was involved in a string of successful prosecutions against savings and loan officials back in the 1980s. He said the problem now is that financial regulators are not working closely enough with prosecutors to investigate and bring charges against executives. ""It is hard, and it does take resources, and it takes expertise in fraud mechanisms so you can explain it to a jury,"" Black said. ""But this is frankly easier than the savings and loan crisis. There's nothing complicated about a liar's loan."" Black said that back in the 1980s, financial regulators routinely referred information to prosecutors to prosecute savings and loan executives. That hasn't happened this time around. Earlier this year, the New York Times published a detailed report on why there have not been more high-profile prosecutions; it's the single best report we've seen on the issue. Its investigation found stark differences between how prosecutors and regulators handled the S&L crisis and how the same authorities are handling the current crisis. (See this chart comparing the two eras.) It also included a list of potential crimes suggested by legal experts outside of the federal government. As we were looking into this issue, President Barack Obama spoke about whether federal efforts have been strong enough when it comes to prosecuting crimes associated with the financial crisis. Jake Tapper of ABC News asked him to respond to the Occupy Wall Street protesters and their anger that the Obama administration hasn't been more aggressive with prosecutions. ""One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehmans and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal, it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless. That's exactly why we needed to pass Dodd-Frank, to prohibit some of these practices,"" Obama said. (Dodd-Frank was an overhaul of the finance industry that Obama signed into law on July 21, 2010.) ""The financial sector is very creative, and they are always looking for ways to make money. That's their job. And if there are loopholes and rules that can be bent and arbitrage to be had, they will take advantage of it. So without commenting on particular prosecutions -- obviously that's not my job; that's the Attorney General's job -- I think part of people's frustrations, part of my frustration, was a lot of practices that should not have been allowed weren't necessarily against the law, but they had a huge destructive impact. And that's why it was important for us to put in place financial rules that protect the American people from reckless decision-making and irresponsible behavior."" Our ruling Moore said, ""Not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America — nobody, (there was) not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008."" Well, there have been a few arrests. Certainly the executives of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker who were arrested would qualify as ""corporate America."" But Moore's larger point is correct -- there have been very few arrests among executives of firms the public would associate with causing the financial crisis. Obama implied in his recent remarks that it was because many of their actions weren't criminal.

But given that the Republican presidential hopefuls are already meeting for weekly debates, we probably shouldn’t be surprised that Our Oregon, a progressive political organization, is already laying the way for its get-out-the-vote effort. Our Oregon’s website makes a call to arms: ""The need for voter registration is constant, especially in Oregon. With our vote-by-mail system, the people least likely to be registered to vote (young people, low-income people) are the ones most likely to get knocked off the rolls each year."" Then they put that need in perspective. According to Our Oregon, overall voter registration is down by more than 119,000 voters from the peak in November 2008. ""That’s like losing a voter every 13 minutes,"" the site concludes. That statistic caught our eye. Could Oregon, which traditionally has high voter participation, really be hemorrhaging one voter every 13 minutes? We gave Our Oregon a call and they told us they’d simply compared the number of voters registered in November 2008 to the most recent registration figures. These can all be found on the Oregon Secretary of State’s website. We followed suit. According to monthly statistics, there were 2,154,288 voters on our rolls back in November 2008. (It’s important to note here that this number represents active voters. If a ballot gets kicked back to the county with an incorrect address, the voter is deemed inactive. That doesn’t mean those voters aren’t registered, just that they need to update their info with the state before their next vote.) Anyhow, back to our analysis: The most recent voter statistics come from September, showing 2,034,589 registered voters. (Again, of the active variety.) Take the latter from the former, and about 119,000 voters have slipped off the registers. There were about 1,060 days separating Election Day 2008 and the end of September 2011. If you put that into the number of missing voters, you get about 113 fewer registered voters each day. Take the number of minutes in a day -- 1440 -- and divide it by 113 and you do, in fact, get 13 minutes. Now, the figures seem to hold up. But one of the things we love to do with PolitiFact is offer up some context. When we thought about the dip in the number of registered voters, it occurred to us that registration a year before a presidential election is probably always a little anemic. (Observant, right?) So we pulled the figures and compared November 2007 to November 2008. We found that registers grew by more than 210,000 over that year. Same for November 2003 and 2004. During that period, registration actually grew by more than 260,000. Just to make sure we got the whole picture, we also checked the percent of eligible voters who were actually registered. During the 2010 election, an estimated 72 percent of eligible voters were registered, according to our secretary of state. That was down 5 percent from the 2008 presidential election. But even that dip seems fairly standard. In November 2006, the registration was down to 73 percent. But in November 2004 it had been 82 percent. This is all to say that during presidential election years, registration surges. We’re not saying Our Oregon got its math wrong. We are saying that the current drop isn’t anything special. For the last word on all of this we talked to Barry Pack, Oregon’s deputy secretary of state. He said that the figures Our Oregon cited were all accurate, but that it’s important to remember that there are many reasons why the number of registered voters might decline. According to a state analysis comparing registration in November 2008 and 2010, about 70 percent of the 250,000-voter decline is attributable to voter inactivity for two federal elections. The other loss came from voter death, ineligibility, moving and other reasons. Many of the folks in that 30 percent, Pack said, ""are not an indication of lack of civic engagement."" We circled back with Our Oregon and talked with spokesman Scott Moore, who said he didn’t think our research negated the point that the organization was trying to make, which is that registration needs to get ramped up -- as always. That brings us to our ruling. Our Oregon said we’ve lost about 119,000 since November 2008 -- one every 13 minutes -- and official figures back them up. The thing is, without the context that this is a pretty cyclical happening, that statistic sounds pretty dire. We think it needs context, so under PolitiFact rules, we’ll give it a Mostly True.

233,pomt-08882,"Says President Barack Obama initially said the national health-care mandate isn't a tax, but his administration now says it is a tax.",mostly true,/texas/statements/2010/aug/02/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-president-barack-obama/,"Channeling U.S. Rep Joe Wilson, the Republican from South Carolina who shouted ""You lie!"" during President Barack Obama's speech to Congress in September, the Republican Party of Texas has accused the president of lying when he said that a new federal mandate requiring individuals to have health insurance was not a tax. ""You lie!"" the party tweeted July 19. ""Obama said O-care mandate wasn't a tax. Now Obama admin says it is a tax."" Did the Obama administration talk one way and then the other? Per the legislation that Obama signed into law in March, most people will be required to have health insurance starting in 2014. There are exceptions, but individuals who aren't exempt and refuse to join a plan will be required to pay an annual penalty of $695 per person, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater. The health care law calls the fine individuals must pay if they don't have insurance a ""penalty."" In a Sept. 20, 2009, interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Obama denied that the mandate to buy health insurance was equivalent to a tax. ""For us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase,"" Obama said. He noted that Americans are required to have auto insurance, but nobody considers that a tax increase. (Auto insurance is a state mandate, but all the states except New Hampshire require it of resident drivers.) When Stephanopoulos pressed Obama on whether the mandate was a tax, Obama said: ""I absolutely reject that notion."" However, on July 16 The New York Times published a story that seemed to vindicate opponents of the health care overhaul who argued that the insurance requirement was a tax. The headline: ""Changing stance, administration now defends insurance mandate as a tax."" Texas is one of 21 states challenging the law's constitutionality in court, but Virginia was the first to face the federal government in a July 1 hearing on its lawsuit. The New York Times pointed to a brief filed in that case by the U.S. Department of Justice defending the individual mandate as ""a valid exercise"" of the federal government's ""power to lay and collect taxes."" Congress can impose taxes to provide for the ""general welfare"" under Article I of the Constitution. From the health-care law: ""The requirement regulates activity that is commercial and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased."" The law then says that national health spending is projected to increase from $2.5 trillion — 17.6 percent of the economy — in 2009, to $4.7 trillion in 2019. In its legal brief, the department says the penalty is also a tax because it will raise revenue — $4 billion a year by 2017, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — and because it's imposed and collected under the Internal Revenue Code. Individuals who refuse to obtain health insurance and are penalized will have to report the fine ""as an addition to income tax liability,"" the brief says. The health care law itself doesn't mention Congress' taxing authority, instead noting that the mandate is protected under the Constitution's Article I ""commerce clause,"" which lets Congress regulate commercial activity that has a substantial effect on the national economy. ""The tax argument is the strongest argument,"" the Times quoted Jack Balkin, a professor at Yale Law School who supports the law, saying. ""This bill is a tax. Because it's a tax, it's completely constitutional."" Balkin is also quoted saying that Obama ""has not been honest with the American people about the nature of the bill."" White House spokesman Matt Lehrich defended the law both ways last week, telling us: ""We believe that the Commerce Clause provides ample constitutional authority for the individual mandate. If anyone has any doubts about that — and we don’t think they should — it’s also clear that that the mandate is constitutional under Congress’s power to tax."" Similarly, Steven Schwinn, an associate professor of constitutional law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, pointed out on his blog July 18 that the Obama administration has consistently defended the mandate in court primarily under the Commerce Clause, and secondarily under Congress' taxing power to promote the general welfare. Henry Aaron, a scholar who specializes in health care and tax policy at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, said Obama was correct to say the mandate isn't a tax. ""A mandate is meaningless unless it is backed up by some 'or else,' as in 'obey the mandate or else,' "" Aaron said. ""The administration asserted the legal power to impose a mandate. The mandate is backed up by a tax that has to be paid if the mandate is violated. You obey the mandate or you pay the tax."" Upshot: In his interview with Stephanopoulos, Obama insisted the mandate to purchase health coverage is not a tax. But in defending its legality, the Justice Department argues in part that the mandate is a valid exercise of Congress' taxing power. From where we sit, Obama was trying to make a political point; the Justice Department, a legal one. In its tweet, the Republican Party overreaches when it says the administration now calls the mandate a tax. The administration (still) isn't doing that. But it does cite Congress' power to levy taxes as authority for the mandate. And that enables the GOP to score its own political point, based on what looks like the administration's runs at having it both ways.

234,pomt-12879,"Imitation dairy products often differ nutritionally from those they mimic, and labeling them ""milk"" or ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" is ""against the law.""",mostly true,/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/27/tammy-baldwin/labeling-imitation-dairy-products-milk-or-cheese-o/,"Hostilities between the dairy industry and its competitors are flaring anew as alternatives to cow’s milk take up more space in the dairy case. That means the politicians can’t be far behind. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, spoke up Jan. 12, 2017 in a news release lauding herself as somebody who ""stands up for Wisconsin dairy farmers."" Baldwin wants Congress to pass the Dairy PRIDE Act -- officially known (at least to a few) as the ""Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act."" After two years of falling milk prices, she and other federal lawmakers want the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to enforce consumer regulations defining ""milk."" Is Baldwin right that imitation dairy products -- for instance, soy milk -- often differ nutritionally from dairy item? And is labeling them ""milk"" or ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" against the law? To back that up, Baldwin’s office pointed us to nutritional labels, and to FDA regulations that plainly state: ""Milk is the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows."" 'Against the law' To dairy officials, inclusion of the word ""milk"" on non-dairy products is a misappropriation of the popularity of cow’s milk. But competitors say coconut milk and soy milk have long histories and aren’t confused with dairy. What’s more, they note, the FDA doesn’t punish ""peanut butter"" for using the dairy term ""butter."" But the FDA in 2008 and 2012 did tell two makers of drinks labeled ""soy milk"" that under its regulations, such labeling was inappropriate because the products did not contain ""milk"" as defined by the agency. ""Soy drink"" or ""Soy beverage"" would be better, the agency said at the time. That -- and regulatory language allowing the FDA to declare a product misbranded and try to block its sale -- help Baldwin’s case. Federal regulations are part of the United States Code that is the law of the land. But to the frustration of the dairy industry, the agency has not consistently enforced that line of reasoning, allowing use of ""soy milk"" and ""almond milk"" and many others. Rebecca Cross, a San Francisco-based regulatory lawyer for food product companies, said the FDA may be viewing labels on a case-by-case basis and allowing use of dairy terms on plant-based products so long as the use is not misleading. Nathan Beaver, a food and drug lawyer with Foley & Lardner in Washington, D.C., explained that foods such as soy milk that have no FDA-written ""standard of identity"" must choose a ""common or usual"" name for their products. Courts, though, have jurisdiction over disputes on the issue and therefore get final say on the meaning of the FDA rules. On milk, courts so far have found that cow’s milk competitors are not misbranded if their names don’t confuse consumers, said Cross. The nutrition comparison Dairy alternatives, Baldwin said, ""contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products."" This is a bit tricky to evaluate given that beverages labeled as some kind of ""milk"" now come from such diverse sources as soy, almonds, cashews, hemp, rice, oats, coconut and sunflowers. For help, we turned to Vandana Sheth, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a leading organization of food and nutrition professionals. For starters, Sheth noted that dairy products can be a good source of calcium, vitamin D, protein and other essential nutrients. Soy milk provides close to the same amount of protein as cow’s milk. Rice milk typically provides minimal protein and is higher in carbohydrates. Almond milk is usually quite low in protein and also less calorically dense, she said. Plant protein tends to be of a lower quality than dairy proteins, though soy is close, said John Lucey, a food scientist who directs the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our own review of labels found that soy and almond beverages, like cow’s milk, are all relatively low calorie, low carbohydrate, low sodium drinks. They are all heavy with calcium. But they feature a different mix of vitamins and minerals, and fat content. Examples: soy milk has a lot of folate, while cow’s milk typically has none; cow’s milk contains some Vitamin C, but the soy, almond and hemp drinks we examined have none. Almond and soy milks feature some iron and fiber -- nutrients typically not found in cow’s milk. ""All the products profile differently,"" said Susan Levin, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition education for the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. Bottom line: Baldwin’s nutrition observation is on target, based on a comparison of milk products. Our rating Baldwin claimed that imitation dairy products made from plants often differ nutritionally from the real thing, and labeling them ""milk"" or ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" is ""against the law.""

235,pomt-11445,"Says the U.S. steel and aluminum industry is ""a fraction of what it once was.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-aluminum-steel-industries-have-/,"President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum, a move that Trump argued would protect an American metals industry beleaguered by foreign imports. ""We’re doing tariffs on steel. We cannot lose our steel industry. It’s a fraction of what it once was. And we can’t lose our aluminum industry. Also a fraction of what it once was,"" Trump said March 6, two days before the tariffs were officially signed. We decided to take a closer look at how these industries have fared over time. Lower employment numbers Trump is correct that employment numbers for metals have fallen sharply. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Steel and aluminum employment is significantly lower today than decades past. According to an analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. steel employment peaked around 650,000 jobs in the 1950s, compared to around 140,000 today. An analysis by Bloomberg shows some 50,000 aluminum production jobs have disappeared since 1990, a roughly 46 percent reduction. As of December 2017, there were roughly 59,000 aluminum production jobs, according to Bloomberg. Experts cited a number of reasons why the metals industry has shed jobs, from improved factory logistics to the diminished power of unions to protect even unproductive workers. But the consensus view is that the biggest cause has been technological advances. ""In terms of employment, the big story is automation across the board,"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which generally supports free trade. So how many of these jobs were squeezed out by foreign imports? J. Bradford Jensen, a professor of international business at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told us that ""imports did have something to do with the loss of employment in steel and aluminum, but the more important factor is technological change and productivity growth."" ""Tariffs won't change that, much like relaxing regulations on coal and pollution will not bring back many coal-mining jobs,"" he said. In short, compared with decades past, the U.S. metals industry can now do more with less. ""If you want to know why the steel industry employs so fewer workers than in decades past, there is the answer,"" wrote Daniel Griswold, a senior researcher at the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University. So Trump is correct that employment levels in the the metal industry are a fraction of what they once were, though it’s worth noting experts tended to attribute this more to automation than foreign imports. Steel output Evaluating Trump’s statement is trickier when it comes to steel and aluminum production. The United States produced about 82 million tons of raw steel in 2017, according to a U.S. Geological Survey estimate. As the chart below shows, that’s well below the peak 137 million tons of steel produced in 1973. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Steel production was certainly higher during the 1960s and 1970s. However, other than these two decades, U.S. steel output has occupied a fairly narrow band in the post-war era, and current output levels far exceed production levels from before 1940. Experts we spoke to said it’s important to look at these numbers in context. Looking only at metric tons of production would not reflect improvements in product quality, for example, or declines in demand. Some noted that the primary metals industries now make up a smaller share of the modern economy than they did in the past. Aluminum output Aluminum is also a bit tricky because there are multiple ways to measure production. One method, known as primary production, involves producing aluminum from raw materials. U.S. primary production of aluminum rose steadily from the post-war era until around 1980, when it began a steady decline. That same period saw increased use of the secondary production, a manner of making aluminum from recycled scrap. Secondary production increased from 22 percent of aluminum production in 1980, to 64 percent of domestic production in 2016, according to the Commerce Department. Due to its robust aluminum recycling industry, the United States now leads the world in secondary aluminum production, according to the Commerce Department. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com ""The recycling part is interesting in that it makes the point of declining need to worry about imports,"" said Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. ""Use of aluminum is rising, but we aren’t extracting as much from the ground as we used to, in part because almost all the nation now recycles metals."" Our ruling Trump said the U.S. steel and aluminum industry is ""a fraction of what it once was."" Trump is correct that employment levels in the metal industry are a fraction of what they once were, though experts attribute this more to automation than foreign imports. Steel output is also not the highest it’s ever been, though experts said it’s important to consider steel production in a broader context that includes improvements to steel as well as how output has responded to declining demand. While the amount of aluminum made from raw materials has declined since the early 1980s, the output of aluminum made from recycled materials has fairly steadily climbed since WWII, and the United States now leads the world in secondary aluminum production.

Chris Christie is very far apart from Democrats on those key issues, according to state Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester). Sweeney emphasized the divide in a recent interview during the June 1 episode of ‘On The Record with Michael Aron’ on NJTV. ""People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care,"" Sweeney said. ""There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them."" Sweeney last week endorsed Barbara Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, in November’s gubernatorial contest with Christie. For this fact check we’re looking only at the claim that Christie doesn’t support these issues -- concerns that PolitiFact New Jersey has addressed previously. What we have determined is that while Christie sees these issues differently than Democrats, it’s not quite true that he doesn’t support them at all. Let’s look back at claims on each topic, starting with minimum wage. In January Christie vetoed a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 an hour, with future increases tied to inflation. So he didn’t support the Democrat proposal -- but he offered an alternative that Democrats reject: phase in a $1 increase over three years and eliminate automatic hikes. Next, marriage equality. Christie, a Catholic, has said repeatedly that same-sex marriage goes against his beliefs, but has said he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples. Back in February, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage and suggested a referendum on gay marriage for the Nov. 5 general election. That suggestion drew fire after several lawmakers, including Sweeney, said same-sex marriage is a civil rights issue and doesn’t belong on a ballot. Finally, let’s look at where Christie stands on women’s health care. State Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) in May 2011 claimed that six of New Jersey’s 58 family planning centers closed after Christie stripped $7.5 million in funding for the centers from his first budget for fiscal year 2011. Representatives of those clinics previously told us that state funding cuts forced the closures. Christie has since rejected at least three efforts by the Legislature to restore the family planning funding that he cut, noting on several occasions that New Jersey residents have access to ""comprehensive reproductive health care services"" at other sites and the state can’t afford to ""provide duplicative funding for family planning centers."" The centers that closed were in rural parts of South Jersey. To recap, the governor proposed an alternative to the Democrats’ proposal on minimum wage that would mean a smaller hike for low-income earners; opposes same-sex marriage personally but suggested it be a matter for public referendum; and cut funding for women’s health care, saying family planning services were available elsewhere. ""That’s 100 percent accurate in terms of the distortions and outright misrepresentations of the Governor’s positions that have been repeated over and over by the Buono campaign and its allies,"" Christie for Governor campaign spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. ""Unfortunately it’s not a surprising tactic from an increasingly desperate campaign that continues to fall further and further behind."" Senate Democrats spokesman Chris Donnelly could not be reached for comment. Our ruling Sweeney said, ""People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care,"" Sweeney said during the June 1 episode of ‘On The Record with Michael Aron.’ ""There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them."" We’ve determined that Christie appears to support a minimum-wage hike, albeit one that is quite a bit smaller than the one supported by Democrats; opposes gay marriage, but supports civil unions and letting voters decide the matter via referendum; and cut funding for that women’s health care that closed six family planning centers in the state.

Charlie Crist vetoed, opponents of the bill often said that Florida teachers were underpaid. They warned that the bill -- which would have linked teacher pay increases to student performance -- would only make matters worse. Dan Gelber, a Democratic candidate for Florida attorney general and an opponent of the bill, wrote in a letter to Crist posted on his campaign blog that, ""the problem with the bill is it assumes the best way to weed out bad teachers is to assume all teachers are bad. While other states are addressing teaching tenure by simply modifying the number of years it takes to obtain tenure, Florida would take the drastic step of eliminating tenure and forcing teachers to work on year-to-year contracts. For a profession that, in our state, is already paid $5,000 below the national average, this will be demoralizing in the extreme."" We have no illusions that teachers enter the profession in hopes of becoming millionaires, but is the problem really as acute as Gelber makes it out to be? We contacted Gelber's campaign to ask about the source of his claim. A spokesman sent us a copy of the 2008 teacher compensation survey from the National Education Association, a teachers union. The report shows that in the 2007-2008 school year, the average teacher salary in Florida was slightly more than $5,000 below the national average. But we discovered the 2008-2009 numbers that Gelber's campaign provided are estimates that are now outdated. The most recent report shows that the actual national average in the 2008-2009 school year was $54,319, compared with $46,921 in Florida. That's a difference of more than $7,000. So Gelber could have used newer numbers that would better bolster his point that Florida teachers are underpaid. Besides the NEA, we found two other widely recognized data sets on teacher salaries. These come from the American Federation of Teachers, another teachers union, and the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal agency. AFT's data is for the 2006-2007 school year. The average teacher salary was $51,009 in the U.S., and $47,219 in Florida, a difference of about $3,800. The federal agency's data only looked at seven states, so it doesn't provide a full national picture for comparison. We should note some caveats about making state comparisons of teacher salaries. The Florida Department of Education notes that surveys may not account for cost-of-living differences and factors such as states with higher percentages of teachers with masters' degreees. We also spoke with Elena Silva, a senior policy analyst at Education Sector, an independent education policy think tank. Silva told us that ""more important than comparing salaries to national average is considering total compensation (such as benefits and pensions) and cost of living."" Unfortunately this data is hard to come by, which makes meaningful comparisons difficult. Still, Gelber said ""paid,"" which to most people means just salary and there's enough for us to assess his claim that Florida teachers are paid $5,000 below the national average. The most recent data from the National Education Association, the source he cited, show that his estimate was actually on the low side and that the disparity is greater that he claimed. But a survey from the American Federation of Teachers suggests the difference isn't as great as he claimed. Still, both surveys support his underlying point that Florida teachers lag behind the national average.

Lloyd Doggett of Austin defended his decision to run in the 35th Congressional District, which snakes from downtown San Antonio north into southeastern Travis County. On the April 13, 2012, edition of KLRN-TV’s ""Texas Week,"" Doggett pointed out that this is the second decade that the state’s ruling Republicans, including Gov. Rick Perry, have tried to knock him out of the House by drawing district lines seemingly to his disadvantage. Doggett, who is not seeking re-election in his newly Republican-leaning 25th Congressional District, said that, in contrast, ""the district that I am running in for re-election to Congress is the district that has more of my current constituents than any other district in the state. I represent or have represented about half of the district; the other half is new."" Sylvia Romo of San Antonio, the Bexar County tax assessor-collector, objected, saying that 55 percent of the 35th district is in Bexar County. Inaccurate, Doggett said, and then the program’s host, Rick Casey, offered up that 47 percent of the district is in Bexar County with 31 percent in Travis County; that is where Doggett resides. ""But I don't just represent Travis County,"" Doggett replied. ""I represent Lockhart and San Marcos and Kyle. And when you include the areas that I serve in Congress, it's just under half of this total district."" Phew. Is Doggett right? By email, Doggett campaign spokeswoman Ashley Bliss-Herrera passed along a population analysis of the 35th district from the Texas Legislative Council, which helps state legislators draft legislation. Bliss-Herrera said the analysis shows that nearly 315,300 of the district’s nearly 698,500 residents, or 45 percent, live in the Travis, Hays and Caldwell county portions of the district. And, she said, Doggett has represented those areas before. We provided Bliss-Herrera with another population analysis by the legislative council indicating that about 41 percent of the 35th district’s residents were previously in the 25th district now represented by Doggett. According to the council, the 35th district also sweeps in residents of the 10th, 20th, 21st, 23rd and 28th congressional districts that will be moot after the next Congress is sworn in. Bliss-Herrera said the latter analysis does not account for parts of Travis County in the 35th district that Doggett has represented in the past. Doggett was initially elected to succeed Rep. J.J. ""Jake"" Pickle in 1994, representing what was then the 10th district taking in nearly all of Travis County. This wrinkle seems believable, though we were unable to confirm as much from available legislative council data.

239,pomt-03861,"Says 100,000 are on waiting list to attend Texas charter schools.",mostly true,/texas/statements/2013/mar/11/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-100000-are-waiting-list-attend-te/,"Texas needs more charter schools, according to state Sen. Dan Patrick, because there are ""100,000 families who are on the wait list."" Actually, the Houston Republican gave the statistic a couple ways as he introduced legislation on that point Feb. 18, 2013, in a hearing of the Senate Education Committee, which he chairs. He first cited ""100,000 families,"" then a few minutes later said, ""155,000 students … are enrolled in charters; approximately, as I said, 101,000 are on the wait list."" His Feb. 18, 2013, press release about the bill said nearly 100,000 parents were on charter school waiting lists. But 100,000 sounds like a lot of anybodies -- as Patrick indicated, that’s about two-thirds of charters’ actual enrollment. According to the state Sunset Commission, those 155,000 charter enrollees equal about 3 percent of Texas public school students. Are the lists that long? We didn’t field a response from Patrick spokesman Logan Spence, and Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us the state did not keep such numbers on charter schools, which receive public dollars but are privately managed and exempt from some education laws so they can try different approaches. Culbertson referred us to the Texas Charter Schools Association, whose spokeswoman Tracy Young emailed us waiting-list counts and some background on Texas charter schools in general. Young said that in August 2012, the association asked its members to report their waiting-list numbers, which totaled more than 101,000 students. Of about 175 charter licensees operating in Texas at the time, she said, 137 were members of the association; 67 of those responded to the survey. Those 67 charter operators accounted for 87 percent of Texas charter school students in 2012 -- 134,532 out of the total 154,278 -- according to the association. On a chart the group sent us, the 67 operators’ wait lists added up to 101,851 students. Two operators accounted for more than half the wait-listed students: Harmony Public Schools reported 44,942 children on wait lists, and IDEA Public Schools/Idea Academy Inc. reported 12,920. 15 largest waiting lists among TCSA members who responded to 2012 survey: Source: Texas Charter Schools Association Operators were asked to remove duplications among their own campuses, Young said. For example, if a child were on wait lists for six campuses run by a single operator, that operator would count the child only once in its total. Young said her group confirmed that at least the operators with the largest lists had filtered out such duplicative entries. But they did not, she said, have a way to ""de-duplicate"" children who might appear on more than one operator’s list. Under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the association could not collect students’ names and addresses, Young said, and school operators did not have a system to compare such individual data with each other. Still, she said, ""We feel certain that it represents a good number of the students on waiting lists across the state."" The association, which formed in 2008, last year sued the state to get public dollars for charter facilities and to allow more than 215 charter licenses in Texas. Charter school operators in 2012, according to an association fact sheet, ran 506 campuses educating 154,278 students. Texas charter schools overall have grown steadily since their inception in 1995, as shown by two charts from an August 2012 study commissioned by the Texas Business and Education Coalition, which used education agency data: Texas charter school enrollment, 1997-2011 Number of Texas charter schools, 1997-2011 Looking for other wait-list estimates, we found no current numbers. But we did spot two older reports from the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation that suggested waiting lists had grown along with enrollment in prior years. The reports, from August 2008 and Dec. 9, 2009, used education agency data and the foundation’s own research on open-enrollment charter schools (the largest category) and university charter schools to estimate that in 2007-08 there were 16,810 children wait-listed (compared with 89,156 enrolled), and for 2008-09 there were 40,813 children wait-listed (compared with 102,903 enrolled). Footnotes said that students could appear on more than one list, but also noted, ""Some charter schools do not keep a waiting list even though demand exceeds supply."" A chart in the 2009 report broke down the wait-lists by region: Our ruling Patrick said, variously, that 100,000 students, families or parents are waiting to get into Texas charter schools. The schools’ association says that’s a little lower than their estimate for students, and it’s plausible that families or parents could be trying to enroll more than one child apiece. The association’s survey only got responses from 67 charter operators, but those operators represented 87 percent of all Texas charter students in 2012. Their reported waiting lists were 75 percent the size of their total enrollment (that is, for every four kids enrolled, another three were reportedly trying to get in). If that ratio held true for the charter operators teaching the other 13 percent of Texas’ charter students (19,746 children), there would have been 14,809 students on those wait lists, yielding a total for all charter operators of 116,659. Then again, the association’s 101,851 wait-list head count could contain duplications, if students were trying to get into schools run by more than one charter operator.

240,pomt-05306,On the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP),no flip,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/did-mitt-romney-flip-flop-tarp/,"The Troubled Asset Relief Program -- the ""TARP"" program that was supposed to stabilize the financial markets -- has not been popular with conservatives. During the Republican presidential primary, most candidates attacked it. But the Democratic National Committee says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on it. On Nov. 28, 2011, the DNC released two videos -- a 30-second version and a four-minute version -- that said Romney flipped on several issues, including TARP. About three minutes into the four-minute version, the word ""TARP"" appears on screen. Then Romney is shown in a split-screen view with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. ""TARP got paid back and it kept the financial system from collapsing,"" Romney says. ""So you feel it was well worth it?"" Cavuto asks. ""Well, it was the right thing to do,"" Romney answers. Cut to another video clip, and we hear Romney say, ""TARP ought to be ended."" Rewind, then again, ""TARP ought to be ended."" Sounds contradictory, right? We checked it out. We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. A fact sheet provided by the DNC tells us the source of the video clips. The first thing to note is that the statement in which Romney appears to support TARP was made after his ""ought to be ended"" clip. So does that mean Romney was originally against TARP, and then he was for it? Not exactly. We researched what Romney has said about TARP over the last four years and found that his position has largely remained unchanged. • In March 2009, Romney told Reuters, ""The TARP program, while not transparent and not having been used as wisely it should have been, was nevertheless necessary to keep banks from collapsing in a cascade of failures. You cannot have a free economy and free market if there is not a financial system. … The TARP program was designed to keep the financial system going, to keep money circulating in the economy, without which the entire economy stops and you would really have an economic collapse."" • A December 2009 clip shows how the DNC plucked the ""TARP ought to be ended"" quotation and distorted his position. His complete statement, in answer to a question by CNN’s John King about how to get the economy going, was, ""And by the way, TARP has served its purpose. TARP ought to be ended. We've got hundreds of billions of dollars there that is being used as a slush fund by Secretary (Timothy) Geithner and the Obama administration. Stop the TARP recklessness at this point and get ourselves back to creating jobs by encouraging businesses to grow, expand their capital expenditures and hire."" • In January 2010, Romney appeared on Fox and had even more positive things to say about TARP: ""That was an investment made to try and keep a collapse of our entire financial system from occurring,"" • In a Republican primary debate in October 2011, Romney said, ""My experience tells me that we were on the precipice, and we could have had a complete meltdown of our entire financial system, wiping out all the savings of the American people. So action had to be taken. Was it perfect? No. Was it well implemented? No, not particularly. Were there some institutions that should not have been bailed out? Absolutely. Should they have used the funds to bail out General Motors and Chrysler? No, that was the wrong source for that funding. But this approach of saying, look, we're going to have to preserve our currency and maintain America -- and our financial system is essential."" Our ruling The DNC portrayed Romney as having flip-flopped on his support for TARP. But the statements the DNC chose for the ad echo what Romney has said on the topic all along -- that a Wall Street bailout was necessary to prevent a financial calamity, but the way the money was administered was poor.

The commercial says ""Virginia papers called Rigell’s campaign ‘Mostly False,’"" and the screen flashes a PolitiFact logo. Since Hirschbiel campaign chose to invoke our name, we decided to examine his claim. Hirschbiel’s ad cites a PolitiFact Virginia article from the 2010 election, when Rigell defeated one-term incumbent Democrat Glenn Nye. The article examined a Rigell ad claim that Nye voted ""in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi"" 83 percent of the time. In fact, Nye voted with the Democratic Party about 83 percent of the time, but with Pelosi -- who was House speaker back then -- only 66 percent of the time. Nye actually had one of the most independent records in Congress and Pelosi rarely voted in 2009 and 2010, a standard for House speakers. Rigell’s statement was rated Mostly False and the Republican also earned a False for another claim during his 2010 run. We should also note that last year, we rated a claim he made about U.S. borrowing as True. This year, we have not rated any campaign statements by Rigell. Our ruling Hirschbiel said Rigell’s campaign had been labeled ""Mostly False"" and attributed his statement to PolitiFact.

242,pomt-08461,"Says Steve Kagen ""promised us jobs, voting for the $787 billion stimulus. Cost: another 77,000 jobs lost.""",pants on fire!,/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/republicans-say-stimulus-bill-supported-us-rep-ste/,"Some folks are disappointed with the number of jobs created by the federal stimulus. But if the National Republican Congressional Committee is right, in Wisconsin, the stimulus is actually a jobs killer. Hmmm. The NRCC works to get Republicans elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. One Democrat it wants to take down in the 2010 campaign is two-term Rep. Steve Kagen of Appleton. He faces Republican challenger Reid Ribble on Nov. 2. In a TV ad, the NRCC aims to turn Kagen’s vote for the stimulus, and two other measures, against him. ""Kagen promised us jobs, voting for the $787 billion stimulus,"" the announcer says, referring to Wisconsin. ""Cost: another 77,000 jobs lost."" When this is mentioned, a goofy image of Kagen giving two thumbs up pops up behind the Capitol building. Similar images -- including one pairing Kagen with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- are used to underscore the message that Kagen’s votes ""cost Wisconsin dearly."" The other votes cited are on the cap-and-trade bill and a vote to raise the debt limit. We homed in on the stimulus claim because it seems so counter-intuitive. To be sure, critics say the cost of the stimulus has bought too few jobs, and point out that unemployment has only grown worse. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, a leading conservative on budget matters, has said borrowing done as part of the stimulus will lead to ""job-killing tax hikes"" one day. But the NRCC is claiming Wisconsin has already lost 77,000 jobs because of the stimulus. ""When I saw that ad,"" said Kevin Quinn, an economics professor at St. Norbert College in De Pere, ""my response was that it was patently ridiculous."" Hold on, professor. Let’s look and see. The ad starts by stringing together some correct information. Kagen supported the $787 billion stimulus (although that estimate has since been boosted to $814 billion by the Congressional Budget Office). And Wisconsin has had a net loss of more than 77,000 jobs since the measure became law in February 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. When asked for facts to back up the stimulus claim in the ad, Tom Erickson, Midwest press secretary for the NRCC, provided the citation on the job-loss figures. But when we called and e-mailed asking for evidence that the lost jobs were a result of the stimulus, he did not reply. Perhaps with good reason. In logic class, this one falls under the category that correlation does not prove causation. Think of it this way: Incidents of drowning may go up at the beach at the same time ice cream sales rise. That doesn’t mean ice cream causes you to drown. It may just mean more people are at the beach. Indeed, the consensus -- from several government and private-sector reports issued in 2010 -- is the stimulus has boosted employment. Directly and indirectly, the analysts conclude, the stimulus has created or saved more than 1 million, as many as 2.7 million, or even as many as 4.8 million jobs nationwide. In Wisconsin, the federal government counted 16,348 jobs directly funded by the stimulus in the most recent quarter (April through June 2010) reviewed. In total, according to the state, the stimulus has created or retained 63,000 jobs in Wisconsin. Let’s return to Quinn, the outraged economics professor. He said he is not supporting either candidate in the Kagen-Ribble race. It’s fair to question how efficient the stimulus has been, Quinn said, but there is no debate it has created jobs, both directly and indirectly. And even though joblessness in Wisconsin has risen, it would have been worse without the stimulus injection, he said. Quinn said the only way he could conceive of arguing that the stimulus killed jobs is if it increased taxes. But it didn’t. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have reported, of the original $787 billion, $499 billion was to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, and about $288 billion -- or 36 percent -- was in tax breaks. So is Quinn alone in his views? No. ""A broad spectrum of economists would say that the stimulus cannot have cost jobs,"" said Laura Dresser, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy (yes, COWS) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""The recovery spending increased demand in the economy, and that creates jobs directly, or indirectly, or saves jobs."" Some jobs are created or saved because they are funded directly by stimulus money, Dresser explained. And others are created and saved indirectly, she said -- partly as a result of spending done by people holding stimulus-funded jobs who would otherwise be unemployed. We won’t add on any more economists. In issuing its attack against Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen, the National Republican Congressional Committee said the federal stimulus bill cost Wisconsin 77,000 jobs. The two things may have happened in the same time frame, but that does not mean one caused the other. Indeed, there is plenty of evidence the stimulus has created jobs.

The presentation is scheduled for July 15 at ESPN’s awards show, The ESPYs. ""Bruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but The ESPYS are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn,"" said ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt. ""She has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces."" That didn’t sit well with many people, who thought there were more deserving winners. Some thought Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old college basketball player who died of cancer, should have won.

""The runner-up was this guy: Army veteran Noah Galloway, who lost an arm and leg to a roadside bomb in Iraq, and now competes in Crossfit events, runs marathons and competed in the 58-hour Death Race."" People are obviously free to debate who should have been selected, whether it’s Galloway, Hill, Jenner or any number of athletes. But the idea that Galloway was runnerup to Jenner is bunk. In a statement provided to MTV News, ESPN said there was no runnerup. There is ""no such thing as a runnerup for the three major awards,"" a spokesman told MTV, referring to the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, the Pat Tillman Award for Service and the Jimmy V Perseverance Award.

In the Oct. 9, 2013, column -- titled, ""Democrats to America: We Own the Government!"" -- Coulter pummels Democrats over provisions of President Barack Obama’s health care law. We were most intrigued by one claim, since we hadn’t heard it before -- that ""no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare."" Really? We tried to ask Coulter through her speaker’s bureau if she could provide any evidence for this, but we did not receive a reply. We are sure the claim wasn't intended as a joke, because it's included in a bullet-point list of straightforward criticisms of the law. So let’s start by looking at the claim literally. Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting ""Obamacare"" patients -- that is, patients who secure insurance through the marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the law? We feel comfortable, both from talking to experts and from our years of reporting on the law, that there is no such provision. If there were, it would probably be ripe for challenge on constitutional grounds. In fact, when we asked experts for their reaction to this claim, their responses included words such as ""outrageous,"" ""ridiculous"" and ""ludicrous."" ""Of course there's nothing in the law that would bar any doctor from seeing any patient,"" said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health. So, no dice on the literal reading of her claim. Still, we wondered whether there was some other tiny, buried grain of truth in what Coulter claimed. Is the idea that American-trained doctors will be pickier about accepting insurance? There is some evidence that medical practices are wary about taking patients from plans sold on the marketplace. In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- surveyed 1,000 physician groups that collectively employ 47,500 doctors. The survey asked, among other things, ""Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange?"" Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive ""yes."" That rate is twice as high as the share that that said ""no"" (14 percent) but less than those that were still weighing their options (40 percent). The top reasons? A fear of bureaucratic regulations, low reimbursement rates and the need to collect payment from patients with higher deductibles. However, it’s important to remember that this study is not evidence that can be used to support Coulter’s specific claim, because it says nothing about foreign-trained doctors. In fact, the closer you look at the issue of foreign-trained doctors, the less plausible Coulter’s claim becomes. According to a 2010 study by the American Medical Association, about 26 percent of physicians in the United States were trained in other countries. This number includes both foreign-born doctors who trained overseas and Americans who received their medical education in other countries. But tough licensing requirements for foreign-trained doctors -- requirements that won’t be changed by Obama’s law -- are keeping the number of foreign-trained physicians low. A key barrier is the need to obtain a residency in the United States, even if an applicant had practiced or had a residency overseas. According to the New York Times, just 42 percent of foreign-trained immigrant physicians who applied for residencies through the leading matching service succeeded, compared to 94 percent of those who had trained in the United States. With such high barriers to entry, it’s not credible that a flood of foreign-trained doctors will suddenly swoop in and, without the help of a single American-trained doctor, serve each one of the newly insured patients who bought policies on the new marketplaces. ""I haven't seen any study that would suggest that American-trained doctors would be disproportionately less likely to see the newly insured,"" Baicker said. And even if there were such evidence, ""disproportionate is a far cry from ‘none,’ "" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""There is no limit to the nonsense that some are saying. This borders on the absurd."" Our ruling Coulter said that ""no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare."" Nothing in the law bars American-trained physicians from treating newly insured people under Obamacare. It’s a ridiculous claim -- one with a whiff of xenophobia -- that merits a Pants on Fire.",None,Ann Coulter,None,None,None,2013-10-16T17:44:30,2013-10-09,['United_States']

But some critics thought there was nothing to laugh about. They quickly accused Obama of behind-the-scenes deal-making with the Russians. The Washington-based news organization Politico carried an article about conservatives concerned about what Obama has in mind when he asked Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for ""space"" until his presumed re-election in November, when Obama would have ""more flexibility"" on objections to America’s missile-defense plan. Obama was unaware the microphone between the two men was still on. ""This is my last election,"" Obama said. ""After my election, I have more flexibility."" Both men nodded. Medvedev said he would pass along Obama’s message to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who will become Russia’s president in May. While some wondered what Obama was talking about, former Georgia state Sen. Eric Johnson, now a lobbyist at the state Capitol, made it clear what Obama’s plans were in a Twitter post. ""Obama tells Russia that he’ll turn over America’s defense system to them if re-elected,"" Johnson wrote a day after the comments were reported. ""Was he bowing when he did this? Unbelievable!"" This was news to us. There have been no news reports that Obama wants to turn over the nation’s defense system to its one-time Cold War foe. Johnson is well-known in Georgia politics. The Savannah Republican ran for governor in 2010. He was once the Georgia Senate pro tem and remains involved in politics. Johnson maintained his position with us, saying Obama was ""up to something"" that could hurt U.S. allies such as South Korea if there is no missile defense system and that nation is attacked by its Communist neighbor, North Korea. ""I think I heard the same thing South Korea heard, that [Obama] is going to throw us under the bus,"" Johnson told PolitiFact Georgia. The U.S. Defense Department has a Missile Defense Agency that is conducting research and developing technology to counter ballistic missiles of all ranges that may threaten the nation or its interests. The United States has cooperative programs on missile defense with a number of allies, including Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom, according to the MDA website. Here’s how Bloomberg News described the missile system: ""In 2007, the U.S. started preparations for a missile defense system -- ostensibly against an Iranian attack -- with its front legs in Europe. The forward radar for the system was to be in the Czech Republic, and Poland would host the missiles that would shoot down any long-range ballistic missiles Iran might let fly. Russia, however, saw the shield as a naked Cold War power play by the U.S. and was mad as hell."" A day after his comments to the Russian leader, Obama said he’s committed to reducing nuclear stockpiles. A national security adviser said the White House will continue to implement the missile-defense system. ""The United States is committed to implementing our missile-defense system, which we’ve repeatedly said is not aimed at Russia,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said in a statement, The Washington Post reported. ""The two presidents agreed it was best for technical experts to spend time determining their respective positions and provide space on missile-defense cooperation going forward."" Vice President Joe Biden also didn't signal that the Obama administration is planning to turn over America’s missile defense system, saying Sunday on Face The Nation that it also helps Israel. Johnson is not buying the White House line. ""I think there’s evidence of [Obama] doing everything to weaken America abroad,"" he said. Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney called Obama’s comments ""alarming."" Romney said he wanted details about what the two leaders were discussing. Johnson, however, took the rhetoric several steps further. His claim seems way off base from anything we’ve seen and read. Johnson said he likes PolitiFact Georgia’s fact-checking. But he vowed to to stick with his interpretation of Obama’s off-script moment. PolitiFact Georgia didn’t see or hear anything about Obama turning over the nation’s missile defense system.

""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in 2016. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" The Miami Dolphins considered penalizing or firing players who kneeled during the anthem this summer. Shortly after the Associated Press reported on the potential penalties, the NFL and the NFL Players Association announced they would not be issuing or enforcing new rules related to the anthem. The NFL is not expected to implement a new national anthem policy this season. While several Miami Dolphins have knelt during preseason games this year, none of them share the names of the players in the article, and no one was fired or penalized. Miami Dolphins wide receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson knelt during the national anthem during the Sept. 9 season opener against the Tennessee Titans, eight days after the article's claim was made. They have not been penalized as of deadline for this story. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

248,pomt-08317,"""Dan Gelber: On the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools.""",pants on fire!,/florida/statements/2010/oct/29/committee-florida-education/group-claims-gelber-against-scholarships-jewish-sc/,"Halloween inspires some eye-catching campaign mailers, including one in the race for Florida's next attorney general. An electioneering group sent a mailer in mid October 2010 with a photo of Democratic candidate Dan Gelber on the front that describes him as ""Toxic to Jewish Education'' with those words written in dripping blood-red, scary-looking type. Has he been lacing kosher meals at Jewish schools with arsenic? Ordering lead paint to be used at yeshivas? Oy vey! The other side of the mailer provides more details. It states: ""Dan Gelber: On the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools. ... Call Dan Gelber and remind him that there is nothing pathetic about our children's right to obtain a Jewish education!"" Gelber, a Jewish Democrat, is running against Republican Pam Bondi on Nov. 2, 2010. But it wasn't Bondi who distributed the mailer: it was the Committee for Florida's Education, an electioneering communication organization. Though Bondi's campaign has repeatedly been quoted in news articles denying involvement, there is a connection to her campaign. The Miami Herald reported Oct. 29, 2010, that Bondi campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley is married to John Kirtley, vice chairman of the American Federation for Children, a national pro-voucher group, which gave $255,000 to the Committee for Florida's Education. Mr. Kirtley is also a Tampa-based Republican fundraiser and the American Federation was the only donor to the Committee for Florida's Education. Kim Kirtley sent an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida: ""In response to your questions -- I reiterate that neither the campaign, or me personally, had any knowledge of the flier. John and I are both professionals who work in the political process, but his work is his own, and mine is my own."" For this Truth-O-Meter, we will research, is Gelber ""on the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools?"" Let's note at the start that the state and the mailer call these ""scholarships"" though they are often referred to as vouchers. And Gelber has been a firm opponent of vouchers ever since they appeared in Florida 10 years ago. The mailer cites a handful of votes Gelber took involving school vouchers, as well as some of Gelber's quotes in newspapers during the past decade. We will examine both. School voucher background Then-Gov. Jeb Bush signed a law in 1999 starting vouchers, which he called ""Opportunity Scholarships,"" that allowed students who attended schools that received an ""F"" two years in a row based on FCAT scores to transfer to private schools or higher-performing public schools. In 2001, the state started the Tax Credit Scholarship Program to allow corporate donors to give money to nonprofit scholarship-funding organizations, which then give scholarships to poor children. The companies in turn received tax breaks from the state. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down the private school portion of the 1999 program, and the Legislature passed a bill to allow students who received those Opportunity Scholarships in the past to get the tax credit scholarships if they qualified based on having a low income. Today, the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program gives a maximum scholarship of $4,106. For the 2010-11 school year, 524 of these vouchers are used at Jewish schools out of 29,651 -- or about 1.7 percent, according to Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters. The students must be eligible for free or reduced-price lunches to qualify. Multiple mailers about Gelber Now, back to the committee that produced the mailers. Elnatan Rudolph, chair of the Committee for Florida's Education, is a Jewish political consultant who lives in New Jersey and is a former Teaneck, N.J., council member. He would not tell us his current party affiliation but said in the past he has been affiliated with both parties. He said he has relatives in Florida, including some who attend Jewish private schools. The committee has sent seven mailers about Gelber to 50,000 South Florida voters, Rudolph said. It also sent a mailer about Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink, and did newspapers ads on Gelber, Sink and Democratic CFO candidate Loranne Ausley. One of the newspaper ads about Gelber, which ran Oct. 22 in the Jewish Press of Pinellas County, was a ""Wanted"" poster for ""crimes against Jewish education.... Voting 'No' on funding for Jewish schools."" All of the mailers and newspaper ads are about vouchers. Gelber's votes and quotes Gelber, first elected to the state House in 2000 and the state Senate in 2008, has voted several times on vouchers. The mailer cites bills that Gelber voted ""no"" on that ultimately made it into law: • HB 21 May 4, 2001: A bill that related to taxation, including providing credit against taxes for contributions to nonprofit scholarship-funding organization. • SB 256 May 4, 2006: In the wake of the Florida Supreme Court declaring the 1999 Opportunity Scholarships unconstitutional, this bill allowed those students receiving Opportunity Scholarships -- if they were poor -- to transfer to the tax credit scholarships. • HB 653 May 2, 2008: Expanded the corporate income tax scholarship program, including making foster care children eligible. • HB 453 April 28, 2009: Made some revisions to the scholarship program. • SB 2126 March 24, 2010: Made still more changes to the program. Let's note here that none of those bills involved Jewish schools specifically. Now a look at the newspaper clips the mailer cited: • ""This program needs major reformation. It's an embarrassment."" St. Petersburg Times, Sept. 24, 2003. The article was about the state education commissioner at the time, Jim Horne, calling for an investigation into the Silver Archer foundation after about $400,000 in voucher money went missing. The article doesn't quote Gelber on his views on missing vouchers money, but here is his full quote: ""I don't want to prejudge Silver Archer -- I don't know what they did -- but this program was an invitation for fraud waste and abuse. This program needs major reformation. It's an embarrassment."" This article doesn't support the claim in the ad -- it just shows Gelber was concerned about fraud. • ""Pathetic is zealously pursuing voucher programs that are not merely unconstitutional, but that bleed resources from a school system that can't afford to lose a dime."" Gelber wrote an editorial for the South Florida Sun Sentinel July 4, 2005, that listed several things he found ""pathetic"" in response to Bush calling the Florida Democratic Party pathetic for payroll tax lapses. • ""Floridians want us to fix public schools not push some right wing agenda to privatize schools."" Gelber was quoted in the Miami Herald Feb. 16, 2006, in an article about Bush calling for a constitutional amendment on private school vouchers about a month after the Florida Supreme Court tossed out the state's first voucher program as unconstitutional. • ""We are funding vouchers while rolling back Bright Futures."" Gelber was quoted in the Tampa Tribune March 30, 2010, in a story about the Democratic attorney general primary race. (He isn't quoted as bluntly bashing vouchers in this article although Rudolph sent us an Oct. 11, 2009, Palm Beach Post article in which Gelber and fellow Democratic state Rep. Dave Aronberg, who lost to Gelber in the August primary, clashed on vouchers. The bill expanded eligibility for tax credits to insurance companies but didn't enlarge the $118 million scholarship program, the Post wrote. Aronberg voted for the bill while Gelber voted against it.) Gelber responds Gelber disputes the claim because he said it portrays him as voting for something specific to Jewish schools, while the vouchers apply to private schools in general. ""There was no vote on Jewish schools,'' said Gelber in an interview. ""I don't support the voucher program."" Gelber campaign manager Christian Ulvert added in an e-mail: ""Dan Gelber aggressively fought for stronger accountability and for reforms in an effort to protect taxpayer dollars. And while he opposes voucher programs because they drain resources from the public school system, they are here in Florida and as such should have strong accountability measures."" We asked Rudolph why he felt it was a fair statement to suggest that Gelber was ""on the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools"" when in fact his votes related more broadly to private schools -- only a small fraction Jewish, less than 2 percent. ""He voted directly against money that is going to help needy Jewish children attend Jewish day schools. There is no way to say he voted against the whole program but did not mean it for one specific group,'' Rudolph said in an interview. ""He voted against a program that funds needy Jewish children being able to afford to go to Jewish day schools. ... That's a fact."" Our ruling We say no, that's not a fact. While Gelber has repeatedly voted against and criticized vouchers for any students, he has no record at all of voting against Jewish education, and it's a crass twist of logic to claim otherwise. Characterizing his long opposition to the voucher program as a direct vote against needy Jewish children is flat-out wrong.

249,pomt-04769,"Says that Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam ""has made it clear by his repeated actions that he will pursue a policy that promotes the interest of Islamist (sic) and their radical ideology as long as he is governor.""",pants on fire!,/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/27/billhislamcom/anti-muslim-website-says-bill-haslam-promotes-inte/,"Earlier this summer, a handful of Republican Party county committees in Tennessee passed resolutions criticizing Republican Gov. Bill Haslam for hiring Samar Ali, an accomplished young Muslim-American native of Waverly, Tenn., and honors graduate of Vanderbilt University and its law school. Now, at least two new websites are attempting to perpetuate the idea that Tennessee’s governor is somehow involved in a massive conspiracy to ""promote the interests"" of ""Islamist radical ideology,"" including ""Shariah compliant finance."" For the purposes of this item, we are going to examine a statement from billhislam.com: ""The Governor of the great state of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, has made it clear by his repeated actions that he will pursue a policy that promotes the interest of Islamist (sic) and their radical ideology as long as he is governor."" We’re feeling déjà vu. PolitiFact Tennessee addressed an associated claim in July when GOP state Senate candidate Woody Degan of Shelby County charged the Haslam administration was ""making our Economic Development Department Sharia compliant,"" in part by hiring Ali as international director earlier this year. The governor and the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) rejected the contention that Ali or the department was doing anything relating to Sharia. We gave it our Pants On Fire ruling as not just false, but ridiculous. At its simplest, Sharia law is the moral code and religious law of the Islamic faith, addressing a variety of personal and secular topics. Aspects of Sharia law do govern business dealings, and some Muslims conduct business only under Sharia-compliant conditions. For example, Sharia may prohibit interest on loans, considering it usury, but may allow other lending fees in lieu of interest. But most people, constitutional scholars and others, agree that attempting to install Sharia as U.S. or Tennessee law would be unconstitutional and there’s been no bills at the state level to attempt it. The voters of Senate District 32 gave Degan a drubbing. He got 10 percent of the vote against state Sen Mark Norris, R-Collierville, in their Aug. 2 primary. Despite that, the shadowy movement that Degan connected with during his campaign has not been deterred. In addition to billhislam.com, there’s another anonymous blog calling itself the ""tn Council 4 political justice,"" which has posted 39 ""newsletters"" on its site since April 9, focused on the purported threat of Islam on Tennessee and the Haslam administration’s role in it. The latest of these, posted Aug. 23, attempts to link Samar Ali’s father, noted Waverly, Tenn., physician Subhi Ali, to The Jerusalem Fund. The anonymous bloggers write that the Washington, D.C.-based humanitarian non-profit’s policies ""reflect overtly pro-Palestinian/pro-Hamas/anti-Israel positions."" The bloggers also claim that ""in addition to making grants for social services in the ‘Occupied Palestinian Territories,’"" a branch of the Fund also ""supports the Palestine Diabetes Institute"" and that Samar Ali served as the transatlantic liaison during the development of that project. From diabetes to terrorism? Those behind billhislam.com make that leap: they titled their Aug. 23 link to the tn Council 4 political justice ""newsletter"" on Dr. Ali and the Jerusalem Fund as ""Dr. Jihad."" They go even further, with one post trying to connect the dots between ""Sharia compliant finance investments"" that the Haslam administration strongly denies going after to the potential maiming of American soldiers in Afghanistan. Dave Vance of Big Rock, Tenn., writes on billhislam.com that ""Apparently, Governor Haslam is comfortable with the distinct possibility ... that at least some of the SCF (Sharia compliant finance) investments on which he intends to spend taxpayer funds will go to provide funds to the very people who are killing American troops in Afghanistan."" It would be one thing if all this had stayed buried in the cyber netherworld but it worked its way into Degan’s campaigns and aforementioned resolutions passed by a few county GOP organizations (notably including the state’s most affluent county, Williamson). Even the governor feels compelled to spend time addressing it occasionally. Last week, his top assistant, Deputy to the Governor Claude Ramsey, wrote the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Chris Devaney, a letter disputing the allegations so Devaney could assure the GOP faithful that their standard-bearer is not a radical Islamist. We will note that Haslam is an elder at Knoxville’s Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. The blog and the website cite voluminous ""research"" in ""connecting the dots,"" as one section of billhislam.com is labeled. But none of it that we’ve waded through has a shred of evidence to support the central claim. We received no response to inquiries to the site’s administrator, listed as Steven Curtis of Dover, Tenn., nor the contact email listed on the website. The inflammatory rhetoric, based upon no credible evidence we could discover, gets a ruling of Pants On Fire! UPDATE (Aug. 28, 2012): billhislim.com responded to our inquiry with an email after 11 p.m. on Aug. 27. The email address contained the name William Vance.

250,pomt-07877,"The city building code violations on my properties only involve exterior issues; ""within the households, it’s fine.""",pants on fire!,/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/07/lee-holloway/milwaukee-county-board-chairman-lee-holloway-says-/,"The condition of rental property owned by Milwaukee County Board Chairman Lee Holloway has become an issue in the race for county executive. Indeed, Holloway says media coverage of the issue has diminished his chances to win the contest. Holloway and his wife, Lynda, own 15 parcels in the city, including several apartment buildings on the near north side. Some of the buildings have been the subject of numerous and repeated building code violations. Holloway was ordered to Milwaukee Municipal Court because a large batch of the violations have not been corrected. That hearing, involving dozens of long-standing violations, is set for March of 2011. Beyond that, a security guard at one building faces misdemeanor charges for accusing him of threatening a tenant who was at odds with Holloway; another tenant faces charges of trashing that same tenant’s apartment; and reports show more than 800 police calls to Holloway-owned buildings in the past two years. So ears perked up at a candidate forum at the Marquette University Law School when Holloway -- who was serving as acting county executive at the time -- was asked about his record as a landlord. He compared the dire economic situation facing some of his tenants with the economic woes facing the state and county government, then described the problems. ""The code violations are primarily storm windows,"" Holloway said, adding ""which we take and provide plastic which is better than storm windows."" He added: ""And it has to do with tuckpointing, which is all complete."" And he said: ""Within the households, it’s fine."" Finally, he declared: ""I’m saying I have resolved these problems. We are working to resolve these problems."" This one is easy enough to check. We looked at the city’s online database available through the Department of Neighborhood Services. Each violation for each property is listed. We counted, and then counted again. At the time he made the statement, Holloway had 200 outstanding violations on eight of his 15 properties. Some of the violations were new -- and written up on Jan. 21, 2011, the same day as the candidate forum. Do they all relate to exterior issues, such as brickwork, as Holloway claimed? No. Some examples of properties and violations listed: 2061 W. Atkinson Ave.: Fire extinguishers, door security hardware, faulty intercom, smoke detectors, carpeting, and damaged ceiling plaster. Other violations for the building include tuckpointing, parking lot repair, windows, screens and downspouts. 2041 W. Atkinson Ave.: Roaches, exit signs, ceiling plaster, floor covering, electrical fixtures, toilet, bathtub replacement. 2021 W. Atkinson Ave.: Fixtures, floor coverings, shower door. 2022 W. Atkinson Ave.: Windows, screens, outdoor canopy, downspouts, handrails and porch issues were cited. And this mention was included: ""Restore ext. door frame to rodent proof condition."" Let’s return to Holloway’s statement. Facing a date in Municipal Court, Holloway told a forum audience -- including those who watched on TV and YouTube -- that the building code violations still at issue involve the exterior of the properties. ""Within the households,"" he said, ""it’s fine."" But inspection records paint a different picture: Roaches, exit signs, smoke detectors, ceiling plaster. All of those -- and more -- are interior issues. There’s even a note about faulty fire extinguishers. That seems appropriate.

251,pomt-00587,"""We’re the only nation in the world that does not use the military to secure our border.""",pants on fire!,/texas/statements/2015/jun/05/gary-painter/west-texas-sheriff-says-us-only-nation-not-use-mil/,"A Texas sheriff was emphatic about the United States being alone on the planet in relying on non-military agencies to patrol its borders. Midland County Sheriff Gary Painter also was incorrect, we found. A Midland Reporter-Telegram news story posted online May 10, 2015 — in the wake of the Islamic State group claiming credit for a failed attack on a Garland, Texas, contest to draw cartoons of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad — quoted Painter saying he had no doubt ISIS has ""contacts in Mexico supporting them. They’re a huge threat,"" Painter said, ""because it is an avenue of approach to get into the U.S."" Our eyes clamped on what Painter said next: ""We’re the only nation in the world that does not use the military to secure our border. We’re not serious about it."" By phone, Painter told us the United States is one of the few nations in the world not using the military to secure the border. He said he based his declaration on news reports showing military forces on the borders of other countries. ""All you’ve got to do is look at the news on TV,"" Painter said. ""You see it."" He said he didn’t remember which countries he saw on those news reports. Experts say not so In contrast, experts we consulted called the Texan’s statement a substantial exaggeration. That said, some countries have heavy military presences on national borders, such as the forces watching over the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea. Separately, Israel’s 7,500-member Border Police, a branch of the Israel National Police, deals with problems relating to public security, terror, severe crime, rioting, guarding sensitive sites and securing rural areas, according to Israel’s Ministry of Public Security. In Mexico, a mix of agencies rely on the Army and Navy and the federal police to watch over its borders, Christopher Wilson of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars told us by phone. But, Wilson said, Mexico’s ports of entry are run by the country’s customs service with immigration-related security managed by its Instituto de Migracion. The military branches provide security at the ports as needed, Wilson said, and also are in charge of stopping and catching traffickers in drugs and people. Wilson said numerous countries similarly rely on military forces to pitch in near international borders in part because some border zones are isolated and other agencies don’t have the manpower. He offered as examples of strong military presences Guatemala and Brazil. Then again, Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University professor, told us by email, countries don’t deploy troops on borders unless they’re engaged in cross-border conflicts ""that necessitate emergency border management procedures. Weak states in sub-Saharan Africa have most recently fallen into this category,"" Burkhart said. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said by phone that Canada and Costa Rica, which has border guards but no regular military, are examples of the many countries that do not secure their respective borders with the military. Then again, many countries have border-area checkpoints run by officers with weapons, he said. Commenting on the sheriff’s mention of TV news reports, Janda said: ""Anything on the news is going to be violence, right? They’re not going to say nothing happened today on the border between Vietnam and Laos."" U.S. Homeland Security For our part, we checked on how the United States regulates border security, then peeked at how Canada does so. In both instances, the military has not been the primary agency handling border safety. By email, Wilson said civilian law enforcement agencies handle U.S. border security. Still, he said, ""we have securitized border management, rolling customs and immigration functions into agencies that have law enforcement and national security at the heart of their mission."" On its website, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it ""secures the nation's air, land, and sea borders to prevent illegal activity while facilitating lawful travel and trade."" Homeland Security’s border security overview says U.S. Customs officials and a record 21,000-plus Border Patrol ""agents, agriculture specialists, Air and Marine agents, and officers guard America’s front lines. These men and women prevent terrorists and their weapons from entering the United States while continuing their mission of seizing contraband and apprehending criminals and others who illegally attempt to enter the United States."" Other Homeland Security agencies relevant to border security include the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), responsible for criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration and the Transportation Security Administration. So, the U.S. military doesn’t lead the charge on border security, which is in keeping with the Posse Comitatus Act, passed into law in 1878, which barred the Army from being employed to execute laws unless otherwise authorized by Congress or the Constitution. Still, Homeland Security has a military component: the United States Coast Guard is entrusted with defending the country’s maritime borders. And it’s not as if military forces don’t get called in. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service said in a February 2013 report, ""Although the military does not have primary responsibility to secure the borders, the Armed Forces generally provide support to law enforcement and immigration authorities along the southern border."" Since the 1980s, the report said, U.S. forces including the National Guard, as authorized by Congress, have conducted a wide variety of counterdrug support missions along the borders of the United States."" The Defense Department’s ""support role in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts appears to have increased the department’s profile in border security,"" the report said. Also, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama each authorized National Guard troops to help watch the border with Mexico, the report said. Canada We didn’t have to venture far to find another country that doesn’t police its borders with the military. Canada’s Border Services Agency says it ""ensures the security and prosperity of Canada by managing the access of people and goods to and from Canada."" Broadly, the agency says it’s ""responsible for providing integrated border services that support national security and public safety priorities."" We spotted no mention of Canada’s armed forces being involved in border security. They’re not, academic experts told us. Burkhart, who helps direct Boise State’s Canadian Studies program, said by email the Canada Border Services Agency handles such duties with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in concert with the U.S. Coast Guard under the joint law enforcement ""Shiprider"" maritime security program in the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. ""The Canadian Forces, the name for the Canadian military, does not participate in border enforcement,"" Burkhart said. Other nations To our inquiry about countries using the military to secure borders, Peter Andreas, a Brown University professor, singled out Germany as a country whose military doesn’t secure the border. ""Of course,"" Andreas said by email, ""all nations that have a military would use the military if there were a military attack from another country."" In the same vein, Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, called the sheriff’s claim ridiculous. ""Almost all advanced countries use law enforcement officials who are much like our own Border Patrol and Coast Guard,"" Alden emailed. By email, Denmark-based author Frank Jacobs advised that most European Union countries don't use the military to secure their borders. He said the Schengen Area describes the EU states and even a few non-EU nations where business people and tourists can freely circulate without being subjected to border checks. Anyone crossing into the United Kingdom faces border checks, he said, though those are handled by Her Majesty's Border Force, which is not a military force, but an agency of the Home Office (Ministry of the Interior). He said that travelers returning to the Schengen Area have to pass through the French douane, but that is not a military unit, instead a part of the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service. Janda followed up by email, calling the sheriff’s statement ""demonstrably false. Most countries in the world use national law enforcement to police their borders just like we do."" He added: ""The only countries that rely on their military to police/defend their borders are nations facing severe instability involving lawlessness and/or refugees in neighboring countries and/or open warfare."" Our ruling Painter said the U.S. stands alone in the world in not using the military to secure ""our border."" We didn’t have to go far to prove Painter wrong. Canada is one of many countries that rely on federal patrols, not the military, to handle border oversight, just as the United States does.

252,pomt-12765,"""Abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions.""",pants on fire!,/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/24/sean-duffy/sean-duffys-base-claim-about-planned-parenthood-an/,"U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wausau) wants states to be able to refuse Medicaid funds to health centers that provide abortions, so in January 2017, the Wisconsin Republican reintroduced legislation to do just that — a bill called the Women’s Public Health and Safety Act. Federal dollars currently cannot go toward abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the mother’s life. But providers that offer abortions can still receive Medicaid dollars for other medical services, such as tests for sexually transmitted diseases and cancer screenings. In a Jan. 24, 2017 news release announcing the legislation, Duffy claimed: ""New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions."" It’s an intriguing statement: The bill hits on a divisive issue in American politics — abortion — and Duffy’s news release provided no supporting information to back-up the claim. When we asked Duffy for details, spokesman Mark Bednar cited a video that an anti-abortion group released in January 2017 asserting, in short, that few Planned Parenthood facilities offer prenatal care. (Planned Parenthood, which has about 650 health centers across the country, including 21 in Wisconsin, disputes the video’s conclusions.) Bednar also provided estimates of Planned Parenthood's U.S. market share for abortions and how much money the group makes by performing abortions. We reviewed everything Duffy’s team supplied and none of it came close to justifying the claim that ""new evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions."" So let’s take a closer look. Calculating abortions At the outset, we note that Planned Parenthood provides a wide variety of health services, not just abortions, according to the group’s 2014-2015 annual report, the most recent one available. Those other services include contraception, hormone therapy, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy tests, cancer screenings and prevention procedures, as well as smoking cessation assistance. To fully evaluate Duffy’s claim, though, we need to get a sense of the relative frequency of the abortions Planned Parenthood provides and how it compares to other services, and there are different ways of measuring that. Planned Parenthood performed nearly 324,000 abortions in the 12-month period between October 2013 and September 2014, according to the group’s annual report. That’s out of a total 9.4 million services provided to patients in the same time period, including: -- 4.2 million tests and treatment procedures for sexually transmitted infections; -- 2.9 million contraception services; -- 1.1 million pregnancy tests; -- 682,000 cancer screening and prevention procedures; -- 95,800 other health-related services; -- 17,400 prenatal services. The upshot is that abortions accounted for about 3 percent of all Planned Parenthood’s procedures and services, the annual report states. Critics and some observers have questioned whether the 3 percent figure accurately reflects the proportion of abortion services at Planned Parenthood centers. That’s because the calculation used to arrive at the number doesn’t distinguish between types of services, their cost or complexity. In other words, one abortion is counted the same as providing a contraceptive or pregnancy test. But there is a second, perhaps more objective way of assessing Duffy’s claim: look at patients. Planned Parenthood had about 2.5 million patients in the 12-month period covered in its annual report, from October 2013 to September 2014. About 13 percent of patients had abortions in that time frame, according to Elizabeth Clark, director of health media for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Put another way: 87 percent of patients visited Planned Parenthood for non-abortion needs. We recognize, of course, that Planned Parenthood has self-reported these figures from their affiliates. Still, the numbers are independently audited, Clark said, and we are not aware of any other sources that can reliably provide the same kind of information. It’s also worth pointing out that because federal dollars generally can’t be used for abortions, Duffy’s bill and other legislation aimed at restricting public funding for Planned Parenthood are themselves an acknowledgment of sorts that the organization does more than provide abortions. Indeed, Planned Parenthood’s single-largest share of revenue in fiscal year 2015 — $553 million, or 43 percent — came from government grants and reimbursements, according to the annual report. Our rating Duffy said, ""New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions."" But that is far from accurate. Planned Parenthood’s most recent annual report covering a 12-month span between October 2013 and September 2014 states that abortions accounted for 3 percent of services the organization provided. About 13 percent of Planned Parenthood patients had abortions in the same period, a spokeswoman said. What’s more, Duffy’s own measure to defund Planned Parenthood underlines how inaccurate this claim is. Federal money generally can’t be used for abortions, so the money he and others want to eliminate goes to pay for, well, things other than abortions. For a claim that’s false and ridiculous, we have one rating: Pants on Fire.

Rowling took to Twitter to accuse President Donald Trump of ignoring a disabled child at a press conference, but she was basing her outrage on a highly edited video that left out Trump’s greeting. Trump invited the family of 3-year-old Monty Weer to the White House on July 24, 2017, while the president gave a speech on health care reform. Monty Weer has spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spinal cord is not completely formed. He is confined to a wheelchair and requires medical treatment, but Trump said the Weer family’s options were limited because there is only one choice of health insurance provider where they live in South Carolina. Trump said there weren’t more options because of the Affordable Care Act. (The family also has acknowledged parts of the law have helped them, too.) A video circulated on the Internet after Trump’s speech, showing Trump not shaking Monty Weer’s hand as Trump walked by. The original has since been deleted, but you can watch a similar video here: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rowling saw the video and retweeted it, then tweeted several more times about her anger over the apparent snub. ""Trump imitated a disabled reporter. Now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair, as though frightened he might catch his condition,"" she tweeted on July 28, 2017. (There’s an archived version here.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com ""My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it,"" she continued. ""So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw."" See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com ""That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect,"" she added. ""How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President."" Except that the unedited White House video showed that Trump did greet the boy, bending down to speak to him as he walked up to the podium (starting at about 2:18 in the video below): See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Twitter users attacked Rowling for her ire, demanding she delete the tweets and apologize to Trump, whom she regularly attacks on the social media site. As of this writing, Rowling had done neither. We tried to contact her through her publicist’s email but did not get a response. (Editor's note: After publication, Rowling deleted the tweets and apologized to the boy and his family. See the After the Fact below for more.) British journalist Piers Morgan was one of the more outspoken critics, posting numerous times that Rowling had lied about Trump. (He also attacked Chelsea Clinton, who had been fooled by the same edited video but later acknowledged her mistake.) Morgan posted an image being spread on the Internet of a Facebook status attributed to Monty Weer’s mother, Marjorie Weer, addressing Rowling and saying ""Trump didn’t snub my son & Monty wasn’t even trying to shake his hand."" The image said ""hand shaking is not his thing"" because he’s so young and that ""he was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch."" We traced the image to a July 30 Reddit post, but couldn’t independently verify that Marjorie Weer had actually written it on Facebook. Our ruling Rowling said Trump was seen ""looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand."" Her tweets were based on an edited video of a White House press conference that had circulated online. The full video of the event showed Trump did greet a 3-year-old boy with spina bifida. In her rush to defend a disabled child, Rowling reacted to only a snippet of video, without taking the entire event into consideration. She also did not respond to calls for her to recant her criticism. We rate Rowling’s claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com",None,J.K.

254,pomt-14970,Says CNN deleted an online poll showing Bernie Sanders won the first Democratic presidential debate to help out Hillary Clinton.,pants on fire!,/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/19/nowthis/no-internet-cnn-did-not-delete-its-poll-showing-be/,"A conspiracy theory rattled the Bernieverse soon after many media outlets, including CNN, pronounced Hillary Clinton the winner of the first Democratic presidential debate. Some of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ supporters said no, Sanders was the clear winner, evidenced by a CNN poll that showed most people thought Sanders was best. The problem: CNN deleted the poll. The theory: CNN deleted the poll to so as not to counter its narrative that Clinton won. A video by NowThis, which shares GIFs and video stories by social media, picked up on a Reddit theory and promoted this video on Twitter and Facebook, teasing, ""It looks like CNN is trying to help Hillary look good, even if that means deleting polls."" Here’s part of the script that was seen by millions: ""The Internet thinks Bernie Sanders totally won the debate. But CNN thinks Hillary won. Even though CNN’s own polls say Bernie won by 68 percent. But that doesn’t concern them. They allegedly just deleted the polls."" The video suggests CNN ""deleted the polls"" showing Sanders won because CNN’s parent company, Time Warner, is ""one of Hillary’s biggest donors,"" spending more on her campaign than ""Bernie’s top 15 donors gave him."" This is just one example of a viral claim. For now, we will skip the part about the conspiracy that focuses on Time Warner’s campaign donations, because there’s a fundamental flaw with these posts. CNN didn’t delete its poll. The poll showing Sanders way ahead is here on Facebook through CNN.com/vote. It’s not on CNN’s website, but it’s not clear that it ever was on CNN’s website. The original link does not appear to be working on some mobile devices. Try this link if you are having problems with the links above. It should take you to a log-in screen and then show the poll, which has closed. CNN’s digital team used a Facebook app to run live polls of users about what they thought of the debate as it was happening. CNN anchor Don Lemon reported on the strong show of support for Sanders from CNN’s Facebook Lounge on debate night. Lemon mentioned how Facebook users thought Sanders excelled on foreign policy, economic issues and overall debate performance. So not only did CNN not delete the poll, but the news channel also did not hide it. It might be obvious, but these are clearly non-scientific polls. NowThis attempted to correct its report on Facebook by posting this update on the video’s comment stream: ""Clarification: This was an unofficial social media user poll, and CNN says it's still live on their web site and Facebook page."" But again, you don't have to take CNN's word for it that the post wasn't deleted, and NowThis can't hide behind the use of the word allegedly. The poll is here for anyone to see. Here's a screengrab we took Oct. 19: Our ruling Sanders supporters are free to disagree with analysis by journalists and pundits of who won the Democratic debate. What isn’t up for debate, however, is the fact that CNN did not delete its poll of Facebook users, who overwhelmingly said Sanders won the debate. It’s still on a Facebook page managed by CNN.

In part, he said later that day, that’s because the very first tweet was launched in the city. ""Austin is where good ideas become real,"" Adler said in a May 17, 2016, morning meeting in Austin with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. Later, Adler said during a ""smart growth"" panel discussion not involving Foxx: ""The first tweet was sent from Austin."" Austin American-Statesman technology reporter Lilly Rockwell sounded skeptical in her tweet reporting Adler’s claim to history: ""Hmm, @MayorAdler claims the first tweet was sent from Austin. I know it became popular at #SXSW but was the first tweet really sent here?"" We wondered too. To our inquiry, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford said Adler occasionally makes his first-tweet-from-Austin claim ""as shorthand for how Twitter became real when it came to SXSW. He often says that Austin is where good ideas become real, and he likes to cite Twitter as an example, though in this case he is inexact with his word choice. The mayor has been duly and suitably reminded that words have meaning but apologizes to no one for bragging about Austin’s role as a launch pad for innovation."" Answer: #CA So, when was the first tweet? After reaching out to Twitter’s press office (not hearing back), we followed the suggestion of KUT News reporter Nathan Bernier, who’d retweeted and questioned Adler’s claim. Bernier guided us to a 2013 book by journalist Nick Bilton covering Twitter’s birth and growth, ""Hatching Twitter,"" which includes a chapter stating that one of the San Francisco-based company’s founders, Jack Dorsey, posted the first ""official"" Twitter update at 11:50 a.m. March 21, 2006. According to the book, Dorsey tweeted from the office of his then-employer, Odeo, a faltering podcast venture. Dorsey’s post said: ""just setting up my twittr,’ matching the wording of a test message someone else sent earlier. Other insiders joined in, according to the book, on what was then a crude website that like a blog, presented a stream of updates. We also noticed a ""Milestones"" section on Twitter’s website showcasing Dorsey’s groundbreaking tweet, though with a Central time zone time-stamp: A web search led us next to a July 2006 TechCrunch story stating: ""Odeo released a new service today called Twttr, which is a sort of ‘group send’ SMS application... Each person controls their own network of friends. When any of them send a text message to ‘40404,’ all of his or her friends see the message via sms. This launched officially today, and a few select insiders were playing with the service at the Valleyschwag party in San Francisco last night."" So it looks like the first tweet was fired off in California. Austin's moment Still, the next milestone listed by Twitter says that in March 2007, ""Twitter breaks through at SXSW Interactive, wins the digital confab’s SXSW Web Award,"" and that mention includes a web link to a description of the prizewinning moment: ""Twitter won the SXSW Web Award tonight in the ‘Blog’ category. Of course everyone immediately Twittered that Twitter won, causing massive waves of SMS notifications throughout the ballroom."" The South by Southwest conference, of course, occurs in Austin. A March 2007 San Francisco Chronicle news story called Twitter the ""toast of the town"" during SXSW Interactive that year. More from that story (which indicates ""tweet"" hadn’t yet gained currency as a noun or verb): ""Large flat-panel screens at the conference had people's twitters floating by in real time. Cell phones beeped and buzzed during speeches. Groups of people stood in pockets at parties, looking down at their glowing phones and PDAs. San Francisco blogger and humorist Min Jung Kim wrote a Twitter haiku observing, ""twitter defined as/turning bunches of geeks to/14 year old girls."" ""Twitters filled up users' cell phones and wore out their batteries. ""It also gave rise to a new lingo. Among the coinages: twittermob, which, in the definition from Thor Muller of Web design firm Rubyred Labs and the forthcoming company Satisfaction, is ‘an unruly and ragtag horde of people that descend on an ill-prepared location after a provocative twitter message.’ ... ""In the words of a twitter from Scott Beale, a heavy twitterer and the head of San Francisco's Laughing Squid Web hosting service, ‘I think we reached Twittercal mass in Austin. It will be interesting to see where we go from here.’"" Our ruling Adler said the first tweet was sent from Austin. That’s not so. Twitter gained momentum during a SXSW conference in Austin, but the first tweet had been sent nearly a year earlier from California, where the company is based.

John McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has taken some heat for her rapid rise from small-town mayor to a national election. So proponents have sought to amplify her achievements to date, which is what led former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to say this at the Republican National Convention: ""She got more votes running for the mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, than Joe Biden got running for president of the United States,"" Huckabee said Sept. 3, 2008. He made the same remark earlier that day to Florida Republicans at the Airport Marriott in Bloomington, Minn. Biden dropped out of the presidential race in January, after an unimpressive finish in the Jan. 3 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Because of the nature of the caucus process, which involves people gathering and regathering in groups in high school gyms and living rooms across the state to signal their candidate preferences, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get a fix on how many Iowans supported Biden. According to a Jan. 4 article in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, the Associated Press calculated ""state delegate equivalent numbers"" that showed Biden got perhaps 2,329 votes across the state. CNN reported essentially the same number, 2,328. It's not clear whether Huckabee was referring to Palin's 1996 election, or her re-election in 1999 — so let's use both numbers. Palin got 651 votes in Wasilla's 1996 election. She did a little better in her 1999 re-election bid, picking up 909 votes. According to Wasilla's deputy clerk, Jamie Newman, the city population now stands at 7,025. Although the precise Iowa tally isn't available, Biden's support as reported by AP and CNN exceeds Palin's 1,560-vote combined total. And it seems likely, based on those projections, that at least 910 actual Iowans supported him, which would mean that as an active candidate, Biden exceeded Palin's single most successful mayoral race. But Biden kept picking up votes even after he dropped his presidential bid. Biden got 638 votes in New Hampshire's Jan. 8 primary. On Super Tuesday in February, he got 3,788 primary votes in Barack Obama's home state of Illinois, and 4,321 primary votes in Hillary Rodham Clinton's home state of New York. If Huckabee is going to compare a small-town mayoral election to a national presidential race, then it's only fair to look beyond the single, hard-to-quantify caucus for which Biden was an active candidate. Iowa aside, his combined 8,109-vote total in Obama's and Clinton's home state primaries alone is bigger than Wasilla's entire population.

257,pomt-03983,Says abortions are decreasing.,true,/texas/statements/2013/feb/12/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-abortions-are-decreasing/,"Responding to a question about lawmakers barring state aid to Planned Parenthood clinics, state Rep. Donna Howard said she hopes colleagues reverse course after they see the impact of clinic closings on constituents. The Austin Democrat, speaking at a Jan. 22, 2013, Texas Tribune public interview, also said such closings could drive up abortions. ""Those who are claiming that they want to reduce abortion, which I think is just about everybody, I don’t think anybody wants to see that increase -- and in fact, it has be.en decreasing,"" Howard said. A reader asked us to check whether abortions are decreasing. We quickly found state and federal figures indicating a decrease. Howard’s chief of staff, Scott Daigle, guided us to information kept by the Texas Department of State Health Services, which says that ""induced terminations of pregnancy"" in the state totaled 77,592 in 2010, down from 77,850 the year before and 81,591 in 2008. Agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams provided a chart confirming those figures and covering additional years. She added, by email, that preliminary data indicate 72,470 abortions occurred in 2011 -- some 5,100 fewer than the year before. The chart shows that while the number of abortions decreased every year from 2009 through 2011, it went up in five of the eight previous years, topping out at 82,056 in 2006. Daigle also said that a November 2012 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that abortions nationally decreased from 857,475 in 2000 to 784,507 in 2009. According to information posted online by the centers, those tallies drew from data submitted voluntarily by states and other ""reporting areas,"" which it had been collecting since 1969. The 2009 abortion rate for 45 ""reporting areas,"" ranging from states to New York City that had continuously provided data since 2000, the centers say, was 15.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years and the abortion ratio was 227 abortions per 1,000 live births. It said the figures were based on data evaluated from the areas that reported data every year during 2000-2009. Compared with 2008, the total number and rate of reported abortions for 2009 decreased 5 percent and the abortion ratio decreased 2 percent, CDC said. ""The change from 2008 to 2009 represented the largest single-year decrease in the total number and rate of reported abortions for the entire period from 2000 to 2009,"" the center says. From 2000 to 2009 the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 6 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, to the lowest levels for the period, the center says. Historically, abortions surged after a key court ruling, then started decreasing. According to the centers’ Nov. 23, 2012, ""Abortion Surveillance"" report for 2009, abortions ramped up after the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing the procedure in all states.: After the decision, ""the total number, rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years), and ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions increased rapidly, reaching the highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing at a slow yet steady pace,"" the report says. ""However, the incidence of abortion has varied considerably across demographic subpopulations, and recent reports through 2008 have suggested that the sustained pattern of decrease has leveled off. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor long-term changes in the incidence of abortion in the United States."" Separately, we asked the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, for its analysis. Broadly, spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said by email, the ""national numbers and rates of abortion were declining from the early 1990s to about 2005, but appear to have leveled off in the most recent period studied."" She pointed us to a January 2011 Guttmacher paper on the incidence of abortion in 2007 and 2008, based on interviews of abortion providers, saying by phone that the next update, drawing on interviews being conducted this year, is to be published in early 2014. The 2011 paper includes a chart indicating that the number of U.S. abortions peaked at 1.6 million and hovered above 1.2 million from 2004 through 2008, the last year shown. The incidence of abortion changed little between 2005 and 2008, the paper says. The number of abortions increased by 0.5 percent, from 1,206,200 to 1,212,350, the paper says, while the abortion rate increased 1 percent, from 19.4 to 19.6 per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Also, the abortion ratio did not change over this period, remaining at 22 abortions per 100 pregnancies. Wind told us that while the decline in abortion had leveled off from 2005 through 2008, this followed a long-term decline in abortion rates. Our ruling Howard said abortions are decreasing. The Texas tally has dropped for several consecutive years, while nationally the total hovered around 1.2 million from 2005 through 2008, by one analysis, and the number and rate decreased in 2009, according to information analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control.

258,pomt-08484,"Since the stimulus package was passed, ""Ohio’s lost over 100,000 more jobs.""",true,/ohio/statements/2010/oct/11/rob-portman/portman-uses-new-and-improved-number-job-losses-st/,"PolitiFact has rapped Rob Portman for certain claims made during his U.S. Senate campaign. We’ve credited Portman, too, for truthful statements. That’s the nature of the Truth-O-Meter: We play it as it lays. Which brings us to Portman’s latest television ad. In the 30-second spot, Portman points to ""out-of-control"" federal spending, ""dangerous"" deficits and an economic stimulus plan that he says isn’t working. ""Since the $800 billion stimulus passed, Ohio’s lost over 100,000 more jobs,"" Portman says in the commercial. The claim about the stimulus program not working has been batted about repeatedly. The White House said when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in February 2009, that unemployment would peak at 8 percent. Yet it is now 9.6 percent nationally, and 10.7 percent in Ohio. A number of economists say that even more jobs would have been lost were it not for the government spending to stimulate the economy. The Congressional Budget Office’s last quarterly evaluation said the stimulus increased national employment by 1.4 million to 3.3 million jobs. There have been mistakes, missteps and gaffes documented in the spending programs, however, and Portman and other Republicans say the spending was poorly focused. This central question will be for historians and economists in the future to settle. We’re merely taking note of Portman’s claim because of this: He uses a lower number -- 100,000 jobs lost in Ohio since the stimulus passed -- than he used previously. When he put the figure at 150,000 in June, the Truth-O-Meter ruled it Half True -- because only 127,900 jobs had actually been lost, judging by the most widely accepted measure. That was based on Bureau of Labor Statistics figures through May, the most current at the time. The numbers come from surveys of employers and are adjusted as the data becomes more complete. Using updated data, BLS now shows the post-stimulus job losses in Ohio came to 130,000 for the period Portman claimed in his earlier statement.. But now it’s October and Portman is using a lower figure when he speaks. As he said in his newest ad, and repeated during an Oct. 8 debate at the City Club of Cleveland, since the stimulus bill passed, ""Ohio’s lost over 100,000 more jobs."" Yet here’s the thing: Portman’s rhetoric might actually be too cautious now. As measured by the latest BLS figures, which go through August and are preliminary, Ohio has 149,200 fewer jobs now than when the stimulus passed. That’s exquisitely close to 150,000. What happened? The state steadily lost jobs through 2009 but the numbers started improving early in the year, continuing through May. The summer saw a retraction, however, reducing Ohio’s employment count by a total of 19,200 jobs during June, July and August. So Portman was accurate and then some with his recent, more cautious statement. The Half True ruling nevertheless stands for his June claim, because PolitiFact doesn’t believe in fortune-telling and Portman’s numbers were in fact off when he made that statement. But we give credit where credit is due. So the Truth-O-Meter takes a turn to the right and rules on Portman’s newest claim: True.

259,pomt-14595,"China is ""practicing how to blow up our satellites.""",true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-china-practicing-how-blow-our-sat/,"The 2016 presidential campaign has inspired discussion of plenty of scary foreign-policy scenarios, from ISIS attacks to cyber warfare. But at a Feb. 3 town hall in Manchester, N.H., Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio offered one we hadn’t heard much about – the possibility that China could blow an American satellite out of the sky. China, Rubio said, is ""practicing how to blow up our satellites."" Experts told PolitiFact that Rubio is basically right. ""Regrettably true,"" Michael Krepon, a space-policy expert and co-founder of the Stimson Center, said of the claim. Most spectacular was an incident on Jan. 11, 2007, when a six-foot-long Chinese weather satellite flew over China and was blasted to smithereens by an 18,000-mile-per-hour missile launched by China. ""And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft,"" as Popular Mechanics magazine put it. China’s destruction of its own missile inspired ""a great deal of international rebuke,"" said Laura Grego, a senior scientist with the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition to bringing up the touchy notion of the militarization of space, the satellite destruction created a sizable debris field in its heavily trafficked band around the earth, potentially causing secondhand damage to other nations’ satellites for the foreseeable future. There are about 1,300 active satellites, according to Scientific American. The technology China used, known as ""hit-to-kill,"" doesn’t technically ""blow up"" the satellite, as Rubio had said. No explosives are involved, only the force of impact of a missile-launched ""kill vehicle."" ""This is the same technology that the U.S. missile defense systems are based on,"" Grego said. ""In fact, the U.S. used the Aegis ship-based missile defense system to destroy the USA 193 satellite just over a year after the Chinese test."" Which brings up a point worth noting: China isn’t the only one playing this game. Russia and the United States have been testing anti-satellite technology since the 1960s. In fact, when the United States, a year after China destroyed its satellite, destroyed one of its own, cables released by Wikileaks suggest was a mission with military significance. ""Russia and the United States either have experimented with or deployed similar technologies"" as China, said Theresa Hitchens, a senior research scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland. ""Indeed, the Chinese are actually behind both Russia and the United States regarding development of these technologies. Nothing China has tested is anything that the U.S. has not tested before."" A further complication: Technologies that can be used to destroy satellites can also be used for benign purposes. Ballistic missiles can destroy satellites – or they can be used legitimately for missile defense. And satellites themselves can be maneuvered to damage or destroy nearby satellites – or they can be maneuvered for repair or refueling, Hitchens said. This is known as ""dual-use"" technology. This makes it hard to discern motives. In fact, China has ""officially said its tests are not aimed at any other country, and it has been a longtime proponent of trying to manage this issue using space arms control,"" Grego said. But it’s difficult to prove a purely defensive motive when dealing with such dual-use technologies, Hitchens said. ""We see them doing dual-use experiments and assume it’s for nefarious purposes, and they see us doing dual-use experiments and assume nefarious purposes,"" she said. This kind of thinking can produce an arms race. Still, experts said it was fair for Rubio to point out China’s development of technologies that can be used to attack satellites, since it’s a threat to national security even if we’re working on much the same thing. ""The reality is that satellites are increasingly valuable to civil, economic, scientific, and military operations, yet they are physically quite vulnerable, since launch mass is at a premium and no one armors their satellites, and satellite positions are predictable,"" Grego said. Our ruling Rubio said China is ""practicing how to blow up our satellites."" For years, China has been pursuing technologies that can be used to destroy satellites (as well as legitimate things). In fact, the Chinese destroyed one of their own satellites in 2007, in a move that was roundly condemned internationally. While the United States and Russia have also been developing similar technologies, and in one case destroyed an actual satellite, that doesn’t undercut Rubio’s statement.

260,pomt-09981,"In Iraq, ""civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, etc., remain very low relative to what was going on last year.""",true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/30/barack-obama/obama-correct-civilian-deaths-and-bombings-are-dow/,"In a news conference on April 29, 2009, President Barack Obama was asked if recent violence in Iraq would affect his strategy or timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops. Earlier in day, three car bombs killed at least 51 people in markets in Baghdad. Obama responded by saying the recent violence should be seen in context. ""Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that although you've seen some spectacular bombings in Iraq that are a legitimate cause of concern, civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, et cetera, remain very low relative to what was going on last year, for example,"" Obama said. ""And so you haven't seen the kinds of huge spikes that you were seeing for a time. The political system is holding and functioning in Iraq."" We checked with the Defense Department and other sources to see if Obama was correct about declining rates of civilian deaths and bombings. The short answer is that he is. The number of civilian deaths and bombings in Iraq peaked during 2007, and has steadily decreased since a surge of forces was approved by President George W. Bush. Obama specifically said civilian deaths and bombings have decreased ""relative to what was going on last year."" So we compared recent numbers with early 2008. According to a report from the Defense Department based on information from coalition forces and the Iraqi government, civilian deaths in Iraq ranged from 600 in January 2008 up to 950 in April. The number of civilian deaths in early 2009 have been markedly lower: 270 in January, 230 in February and 260 in March. That's dramatically lower than late 2006 and early 2007, when civilian deaths were about 3,500 a month. As for bombings, those too hit a peak in early 2007, with about 130 in February of that year. By early 2008, they were down to 40 to 60 explosions per month. The recent report to Congress noted that current levels of bombings were lower than at any time since the spring of 2004, but added that al-Qaida ""retains the intent and capability to carry out spectacular attacks."" Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the Defense Department, told PolitiFact that in addition to fewer bombings, there has been a shift in targets. At the height of violence in years past, he said, most bombings were aimed at U.S. military and Iraq military and security forces. Recent attacks have targeted mosques, markets and other ""soft targets"" in an attempt to incite sectarian violence. That suggests opposition resources are more limited than in the past, Ryder said. The nonpartisan Brookings Institution also puts out something called the Iraq Index that keeps monthly tabs on security and reconstruction in Iraq. The detailed reports track the number of multiple-fatality bombings (more than a third of them from suicide bombings), as well as the number of people killed and wounded in those bombings. Both also back up Obama's contention. We note that Brookings bases much of its data on information from the U.S. government, but also gets information from press reports and other sources. So information from coalition forces in Iraq, the Iraqi government and press reports all back up Obama's statement.

Edward Markey, D-Mass., attacked President Donald Trump for his stance on drilling and portrayed Congress as doing nothing in the aftermath of the 2010 explosion. ""Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP,"" Markey tweeted April 20. We wanted to know what Trump’s plans were and if Congress has done nothing since the explosion. The April 20, 2010, explosion of BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig was the worst offshore drilling catastrophe in U.S. history. The explosion killed 11 workers, and 134 million gallons of oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico. We emailed a spokesman for Trump and did not get a reply; however, a spokesman for the Bureau of Ocean Management sent information about the reorganization of federal agencies that oversee drilling during the Obama administration. Trump on drilling In 2006, Congress passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida’s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022. There have been efforts by some Republicans to expand offshore drilling, but so far they have failed. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La, sponsored The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016 to allow drilling 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf Shores, but the Senate rejected moving ahead on it in November. In response, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., filed a bill to extend the ban by five years, but the Senate hasn’t voted on his bill. During the campaign, Trump generally spoke favorably of expanding oil drilling, although he sounded skeptical about a proposal to allow offshore drilling closer to the Florida beaches in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, PolitiFact’s parent company, in February 2016. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" But later in the campaign Trump endorsed more drilling and promised to ""accomplish a complete American energy independence. Complete. Complete."" Trump’s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands. A couple months into his administration in March, Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development starting in August 2017. That was similar to the Obama administration plan. As he was leaving office, President Barack Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans for the next five years, but allowed it in the gulf primarily in areas other than Florida. But despite Trump’s rhetoric, the industry hasn’t shown much interest in expanding drilling due to low oil prices, said Athan Manuel, who directs Sierra Club’s Lands Protection Program. ""Ideologically the Trump administration wants to push drilling everywhere, but companies are being cautious right now because the cost so low,"" he said. On March 28, Trump issued an executive order that called for a review of agency actions that ""potentially burden the safe, efficient development of domestic energy resources,"" including oil. Regulations following explosion After BP’s Deepwater Horizon explosion, lawmakers couldn’t agree on safety standard legislation. In 2010, the House approved an overhaul of safety standards, but it never got the approval in the Senate. The Obama administration took some steps to tighten rules in an effort to avoid similar spills, although the rules took several years to develop, and some environmentalists have criticized them as insufficient. In April 2015 -- five years after the explosion -- the administration unveiled a proposed rule to tighten safety standards for blowout preventers, devices that are designed to stop undersea oil wells from exploding. During the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the blowout preventer malfunctioned. The rule was finalized in March 2016. Bob Bea, an expert on risk management and a former Shell executive, told PolitiFact that little has changed in either the regulatory regime or the industrial regime in the United States. He repeatedly said during the Obama administration that the government hadn’t gone far enough in terms of risk assessment. ""Yes, new government 'rules' have been enacted, and new industry 'guidelines' have been issued, but either they have not been implemented or they have not been implemented properly,"" he said. The Government Accountability Office reported in March 2017 that the Interior Department has struggled to successfully implement key initiatives to improve offshore oversight. For example, a risk-based facility inspection initiative was halted due to concerns about its usefulness and unclear protocols. Our ruling Markey tweeted, ""Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP."" During the campaign, Trump frequently expressed support to open up more oil drilling. Since in office, his administration proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore starting in August 2017. After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, Congress couldn’t agree on safety standards. The Obama administration took some steps to improve safety standards, though some environmentalists say that the government didn’t go far enough. We rate this claim True.

John Kitzhaber counted the ways. Unemployment is falling, our credit rating is rising, the state ranks as one of the friendliest to business and just last year, Oregon had ""the second fastest growing economy in the nation."" It was that last one that caught our ear. Oregon usually lags behind the country -- but when the state is hot, it’s hot, so it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. Still we decided to check it out. We got in touch with Amy Wojcicki, the governor’s spokeswoman, and she reminded us of an article The Oregonian published last June. The story’s headline spoke for itself: ""Oregon economy growing at nation’s second-fastest rate."" The story cited figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Statistics. In 2011, Oregon’s gross domestic product increased by 4.7 percent. The state was second only to North Dakota, which saw its GDP grow by 7.6 percent that year. The numbers show the governor was right. Still, we decided to dig just a little bit further because we know, when it comes to economics and statistics, nothing is ever quite as clear cut as it seems. We called up Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economist. ""That's the fact -- you can certainly point to it."" But, he added, ""I would be wary. ""I think it's important to recognize that a significant amount of those gains came from manufacturing"" -- particularly microchips and related industries. All of this was covered in the original article. Indeed, manufacturing was far and away the biggest driver of growth that year. Intel alone had huge growth. So, we asked, what’s the problem with that? ""It's a real effect,"" Duy said, ""But is this the experience of the average Oregonian? I don't think the average Oregonian perceives the economy as growing at the second fastest rate in the nation."" We asked Duy if he could suggest another measurement that might provide a fuller picture -- he suggested the rate of job growth. Fortunately, this just came up in the state’s most recent revenue forecast. According to that report, which based its numbers on figures from the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, Oregon ranks 26th overall in that category. Said another way: We’re perfectly average. In a recent speech, Gov. Kitzhaber mentioned that a year ago, Oregon boasted the second-fastest growing economy in the nation. It was just one fact of several that he referenced to make the point that the state is rebounding from a dismal recession. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the governor’s statement is accurate. We agree with Duy that most Oregonians don’t feel like they’re living in an economic boom, but that doesn’t make the governor wrong.

Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, who boasts about his vote against the bank bailout package that has haunted some incumbents seeking re-election. When the U.S. House passed the legislation Oct. 3, 2008, most Democrats voted for it while a majority of Republicans said no. In the ad, Doggett says: ""I said no to these big bank bailouts. We need to focus our resources on helping Central Texas, not Wall Street."" We ran his claim through the Truth-O-Meter after a reader urged us to check it out. First, the big picture: In 2008, after a housing boom, the bubble burst when securities backed by risky mortgages contaminated the greater financial system. The markets tanked and the government scrambled to pick up the pieces. In September of that year, the government seized control of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which had funded more than two-thirds of recent home loans, investment bank Lehman Brothers went under, and the government swooped in to rescue insurance company American International Group. Amid uncertainty, and with the stock markets nosediving, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke proposed a sweeping $700 billion plan to bailout financial institutions. President George W. Bush and presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain supported Paulson's proposal, which called for the launch of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, described as an effort to stabilize the economy by authorizing the treasury secretary to buy toxic assets, largely comprised of shaky mortgage-backed securities — essentially bad debts. Over the next three months, Paulson bolstered banks with $350 billion, according to an evolving summary of the credit crisis by The New York Times. Last month, the Times reported that the TARP bailout ""could conceivably earn taxpayers a profit."" However, ""a final accounting of the government's full range of interventions in the economy, including the bailouts of the mortgage financial giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is years off and will most likely remain controversial and potentially costly."" At the time, constituents weren't keen on bailing out big banks and other financial institutions. ""For most voters, TARP remains a four-letter word,"" according to the Times. Distrust was also simmering in Congress. On Sept. 30, 2008, the Austin American-Statesman reported that the day before, ""three of the four U.S. House members from the Austin area broke with their party leaders Monday and voted against the rescue plan for the financial markets."" Doggett joined Reps. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, and John Carter, R-Round Rock, in voting to defeat the rescue plan. San Antonio Rep. Lamar Smith, a Republican who represents part of Travis County, voted for the legislation. ""In a sign of just how little weight President Bush carries in even his home state these days, just four of the 19 Texas Republicans in the House voted for his bailout plan,"" the Statesman reported. ""Five of the 13 Texas Democrats voted for it. The local lawmakers voting no all said they wanted Congress to spend more time looking at different solutions to the financial crisis."" Doggett had been meeting with William Isaac, who was chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. under President Ronald Reagan, according to the Statesman. Isaac had suggested that the administration could mollify the markets by raising the limit on the amount of deposits insured by the FDIC, among other measures. Doggett said: ""It strikes me that these are sensible steps that would address market concerns without such a huge cost to the taxpayer."" A Statesman editorial published the same day observed that ""you know a bill is in trouble when conservative Republican John Carter of Round Rock and liberal Democrat Lloyd Doggett of Austin both vote against it."" The House killed that measure, 228-205, and the stock market further spiraled. Then, two days later, the Senate voted 74-25 in favor of a modified $700 billion bailout plan. The crux of the legislation was intended to stabilize the economy and prevent further disruption to the economic system by giving the government authority to purchase and insure certain types of troubled assets. At the time, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said on Fox News that the Senate bill had a ""much better chance"" of making it through the House, according to an Oct. 2, 2008, Los Angeles Times news story. ""I do think that the big (stock market) drop on Monday really had a chilling effect on a lot of our members and a lot of our constituents,"" he said. The Dow had plunged 800 points, according to a timeline of the crisis by The Washington Post. Doggett wasn't won over. ""The Senate measure has changed my position from 'no' to 'heck no,'"" he said, according to the Times. On the floor of the House Oct. 3, Doggett suggested the bailout was a rash, irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars. ""What Bush demands on this subrprime lending debacle is for taxpayers to reward Wall Street with what is essentially the biggest subprime loan in American history,"" he said. ""We cannot afford to give almost unlimited discretion to one man to determine what toxic securities to buy and on what terms. We should not bail out the entire world."" The Senate approach cleared the House Oct. 3, 2008 by 263-171. In the Texas delegation, nine Democrats and six Republicans voted yes, while four Democrats and 13 Republicans voted no. The Texas delegates who switched votes between versions of the bailout — going from ""no"" to ""yes"" — were Al Green, D-Houston, Mike Conaway, R-Midland, Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, and Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo. Doggett was quoted in the Oct. 3 American-Statesman saying: ""When markets are poisoned, you demand the best antidote to that poison ... not yield to President Bush's take-it-or-leave-it demand."" So, Doggett twice voted against the TARP measure, the plan since widely called a ""bailout."" We rate his statement as True.",None,Lloyd Doggett,None,None,None,2010-10-07T18:10:21,2010-10-04,['None']

The stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, included tax cuts for many Americans, Obama said. ""We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses,"" Obama said. ""We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college."" Democrats applauded, while Republicans were silent for the most part. In one of the unscripted moments of the night, Obama looked at the Republican side of the room, smiled and said, ""I thought I'd get some applause on that one."" Here, we wanted to check Obama's statement that he cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. The key word in his statement is ""working."" Obama's claim is based on a tax cut intended to offset payroll taxes. Under the stimulus bill, single workers got $400, and working couples got $800. The Internal Revenue Service issued new guidelines to reduce withholdings for income tax, so many workers saw a small increase in their checks in April 2009. The tax cut was part of Obama's campaign promises. During the campaign, Obama said he wanted $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. Since the final number was a bit less than he promised, we rated his promise a Compromise on our Obameter, where we rate Obama's campaign promises for fulfillment. During the campaign, the independent Tax Policy Center researched how Obama's tax proposals would affect workers. It concluded 94.3 percent of workers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan based on the tax credit to offset payroll taxes. According to the analysis, the people who wouldn't get a tax cut are those who make more than $250,000 for couples or $200,000 for a single person. Obama said he intended to raise taxes on those high earners, a promise he reiterated during the State of the Union, and that revenue would offset the stimulus tax cut. Because the stimulus act did give that broad-based tax cut to workers, we rate Obama's statement True.",None,Barack Obama,None,None,None,2010-01-28T00:02:13,2010-01-27,['None']

During the campaign to persuade voters to mark ""yes"" on their ballots, the Library Yes! Committee made a number of arguments in the district’s favor. One of the most ubiquitous was the oft-repeated fact that the Multnomah County Library was the ""second busiest in the nation."" Given that Portland doesn’t even crack the 25 largest cities in the nation (by population), this fact has always struck us as pretty interesting. During the campaign season, we were a bit distracted with various other claims, but now that things are bit quieter, we thought we’d come back to this one -- if only for curiosity’s sake. We e-mailed Liz Kaufman, who handled media requests for the library district campaign, and she quickly followed up with a handy breakdown of statistics about the Multnomah County Library and its peer institutions, compiled by the American Library Association. The association doesn’t track how ""busy"" a system is per se, but it does check the circulation -- or the total number of items issued in a given year. By that measure, the Multnomah County system is, indeed, the second busiest with 23,946,498. We followed up with a phone call to the association for good measure and spoke with Macey Morales, their media point-person. She cautioned that their figures came from the Public Library Associations’ survey. ""A total of 1,300 libraries from the U.S. and Canada voluntarily complete the survey, so the report reflects a sample of public libraries in North America,"" she wrote in a follow-up e-mail. That said, the Multnomah County system does have the second highest circulation in the most recent survey. The New York Public Library comes in first -- although to be fair, that system has some 87 branches compared to Multnomah’s 18. A quick aside: We also have the second highest circulation per capita. In that category, we were edged out -- 33 to 34 per person a year -- by Ohio’s Cuyahoga County Public Library. Morales did point us to one other source, the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The institute does a more complete library census, looking at some 9,000 systems. The catch there is that their figures take a while to get published. They’re currently waiting on 2010 figures. A report released by the institute in December 2009, said Multnomah County Library boasted the third highest circulation rate in the country -- there’s no mention of who is first or second. Those figures, of course, would be somewhat dated compared to the other survey -- though potentially more complete.

CBS Sports announcer James Brown touched on this in a 90-second monologue directed to all men during the Sept. 11 pregame broadcast of Thursday Night Football, which coincidentally featured Rice’s former team, the Baltimore Ravens, against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Brown urged men to learn ""what healthy, respectful manhood is all about"" and to ""give help or to get help, because our silence is deafening and deadly."" Then he pulled out a stirring statistic. ""Consider this: According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners,"" Brown said. ""That means that since the night Feb. 15 in Atlantic City (the night Ray Rice hit now-wife Janay Rice on the elevator) more than 600 women have died."" The figure is used across several outreach group websites, including Futures Without Violence, the Domestic Abuse Shelter of the Florida Keys, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Arkansas Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Experts say the claim is accurate. While the veracity of crime statistics in general can be questioned due to underreporting by victims and mislabeling by the investigating officer, murder statistics are reliable, experts say. The biggest repository for national crime statistics is the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report, which is based on data collected from local law enforcement agencies. Callie Rennison is a University of Colorado Denver public affairs professor who analyzes crime trends. Crunching federal figures, Rennison found 3.3 women died at the hands of their intimate partners per day in 2010. To get that figure, she divided the number of intimate partner homicides with female victims (1,192) by the number of days in the year. More than three days a day is alarmingly high, but it’s also down from a recent high of 4.2 deaths per day in 1993. Rennison did not run a similar calculation for the most recent years available, 2011 and 2012, but the trend holds. Of course, this is a daily average and not an exact representation of how many women are killed by their current or former partners. ""So strictly scientifically speaking, it is a risk to estimate how many people have been killed in domestic violence incidents since Feb. 15,"" said Mary Koss, University of Arizona public health professor. ""However, doing so is not fundamentally wrong and crime experts do it frequently."" Because the number of male victims in intimate partner homicides is much lower, so too is the daily average. There were 305 of these deaths in 2010, which amounts to a daily average of 0.84. James Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor, sliced the data differently for his own count of intimate partner homicides. He factored in unsolved homicide cases believed to have involved intimate partners. The result: slightly higher deaths per year. Using his numbers,the daily average of female deaths was 3.84 in 2010, 3.61 in 2011, and 3.68 in 2012. Brown could have been a touch more precise with his wording by saying ""partners and former partners"" instead of just ""partners,"" but Rennison says that level of distinction is probably more important to academics. ""Generally when we talk in our field (about FBI or Bureau of Justice Statistics figures), we’re talking about current or former spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend, and it can include same-sex partners as well,"" she said. Our ruling Brown implored the NFL community and beyond to consider a shocking statistic: ""According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners."" He went on to estimate how many women have been killed by their partners since the day Rice attacked his now-wife in an elevator -- a practice experts said isn’t scientifically precise but is a common practice. As for the three-deaths-a-day figure itself, experts said it is accurate. By some measures, the daily average is actually closer to four deaths. There are some ways that Brown could have been more precise, but they do not obscure his point. So we rate his claim True.",None,James Brown,None,None,None,2014-09-16T16:40:08,2014-09-11,['None']

So I strongly disagree with any assertion that I've been more at odds with the president of the United States than I have been in agreement with him."" The interview makes interesting reading today because several of Russert's questions are based on comments from another senator who had just returned from Iraq in June 2005 — Biden.

Roger Williams, who represents the 25th Congressional District running north and west from Austin to just south of Tarrant County, declared that he always commits to a position on issues before the House--never voting ""present"" the ""chicken way."" A reader asked us to fact-check Williams's tout. Williams, a former Texas secretary of state who faces Democratic nominee Julie Oliver on the November 2018 ballot, was asked by Maria Bartiromo, who hosts the Fox Business Network’s ""Mornings with Maria,"" why some Democratic colleagues had voted ""present"" instead of ""yes"" or ""no"" on a House-approved resolution. The measure expressed support for officers who carry out the mission of Immigration & Customs Enforcement, the agency that some Democrats lately say should be disbanded. The House vote on the resolution was 244-35 with 18 Democrats joining Republicans favoring the proposal and 34 voting against it, The Hill reported--with another 133 Democrats voting ""present"" as urged by Democratic leaders. The leadership ""strategy was aimed at both protecting vulnerable Democrats from a contentious vote,"" The Hill said, ""and protesting what most Democrats deemed a political stunt designed to distract the media and the public from Congress’s failure to enact immigration reforms, including efforts to address the separation of migrant families on the U.S.-Mexico border,"" its story said. The morning after the House action, Bartiromo asked Williams: ""How do you justify voting ‘present?’"" Williams replied: ""Well, I never voted ‘present.’ So I don’t know that I can justify it. It’s the chicken way out is the only way I know we can put it."" Checking vote histories We didn’t divine a way to plumb a government website to determine if Williams, who joined the House in 2013, had never voted ""present."" But to our inquiry, Joshua Tauberer, founder of GovTrack.us, a site that compiles congressional votes, confirmed Williams’s statement. Tauberer said by email that Williams, who as of late July 2018 had been eligible to vote in 3,604 roll-call votes, ""has never voted ‘present,’ except in quorum calls where ‘present’ is the only vote one can make."" Tauberer told us he reached his conclusion by querying the site’s internal database of votes, which he described as built in part from member votes posted by the House clerk. We were curious too about other Texas members voting ""present."" On that front, Tauberer emailed us a spreadsheet showing more than 1,900 ""present"" votes by Texans since 1990, though most weren’t substantive, we found. We sifted the provided information to find that 26 Texas members, from both parties, accounted for more than 680 non-procedural votes of ""present"" since 1990 with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, leading the delegation with 84 votes of ""present"" followed by Democratic Rep. Gene Green of Houston, with 61. According to our sort, Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis placed third with 59 ""present"" votes; he was trailed by GOP Reps. Sam Johnson of Plano and Lamar Smith of San Antonio, with 57 ""present"" votes each, and Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, who voted ""present"" 50 times. We sifted the information even more to find that since Williams joined the House in 2013, 11 House Democrats had voted ""present"" 20 times across nine issues -- topped by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, doing so five times. Most recently, the results show, Reps. Green and Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen each voted ""present"" on the ICE resolution that Williams supported. Since 2013, the information indicates, no Texas Republicans in the House voted ""present"" on non-procedural issues. Outside analyst Finally, we asked an expert on Congress generally about the prevalence and significance of ""present"" votes. Steven Smith, a Washington University political scientist, said by email that party strategy or an individual’s political calculation often underlie the semi-rare ""present"" votes. ""At times, a legislator may want to avoid committing to the ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ position without reducing his or her rate of voting participation,"" Smith wrote. ""The legislator will be counted as having voted but without having committed to either side. This probably can be rationalized as having unacceptable alternatives, but it avoids adding a vote for or against a cause, group or constituency,"" Smith said. Our ruling Williams said he’s never voted ""present"" instead of taking a position on issues before the House. That’s backed up by research we elicited from the founder of the GovTrack.us website.

So the president claimed on 60 Minutes , interrupting interviewer Steve Kroft to tout the continued support of Warren Buffett, the Omaha-based stock-picker extraordinaire. ""Your plan really for solving the banking crisis was met with very, very, very tepid response,"" Kroft said to Obama. ""A lot of people said they didn't understand it. A lot of people said it didn't have any, enough details to solve the problem. I know you're coming out with something next week on this. But these criticisms were coming from people like Warren Buffett, people who had supported you, and you had counted as being your..."" ""And Warren still does support me,"" Obama interjected. ""But I think that, understand, Warren's also a big player in the financial markets who's a major owner of Wells Fargo. And so he's got a perspective from the perspective of somebody who is part owner of a bank."" Indeed Buffett, who endorsed Obama during the campaign, did explicitly say during a three-hour interview March 9 with CNBC that he still supports Obama. ""I voted for Obama and I strongly support him, and I think he's the right guy,"" Buffett said early in the interview. Buffett did criticize Obama's handling of the banking crisis, saying that ""a bank that's going to go broke should be allowed to go broke,"" as long as the depositors are protected. (Obama's approach has leaned toward giving the banks more bailout money in some form rather than letting them fail and having the government take them over.) But Buffett's primary concern was that Obama wasn't communicating clearly with the public about struggling banks. ""The right answer for me (to the banking crisis) is the president to clarify things as only he can, because you have heard so many different things,"" he said. ""He is the commander in chief on this, and it has to be clarified ... because if people aren't clear, they're going to be confused. And if they're going to be confused, they are going to be scared stiff. And that has to end."" It's not surprising Buffett would want Obama to focus on the financial crisis — it has cost Buffett $25 billion. That's how much of his $62 billion fortune he lost in the past year, as shares of his holding company Berkshire Hathaway fell nearly 50 percent, Forbes reports. That knocked Buffett off his perch as the world's richest man, to No. 2 behind Bill Gates. Toward the end of the three-hour interview, Buffett reiterated his support for Obama. ""He is the right president,"" Buffett said. ""He's very, very smart. He's got, I think, exactly the right goals. He's articulate and I — you know, he will be the right person to be the commander in chief in this economic crisis."" So clearly Obama was on solid ground touting Buffett's continued support.

270,pomt-03459,"""Some of these members of the House of Representatives get hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies"" but want to cut food stamps.",true,/ohio/statements/2013/jun/18/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-lawmakers-who-take-farm-sub/,"Congress is deciding whether to reform the nation’s farm subsidy system and, while it is at it, will probably cut the amount it dedicates to food stamps for the poor and low-income workers. Both programs are part of what’s known as the farm bill, the five-year authorization that sets the terms for government crop assistance and defines eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It turns out that some Congress members receive farm subsidies themselves, or get them through farms and corporations they and their relatives own. Whether they should or shouldn’t is not for us to say. Proponents and opponents of the subsidies, primarily direct payments made to farm owners, can be found in both political parties. But U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, finds it disconcerting that some of the lawmakers who gladly take the government’s subsidies want to cut SNAP, or subsidies to people who need help buying groceries. Discussing the 2013 farm bill, which recently passed in the Senate and is under debate in the House, Brown told reporters on a conference call on June 12, ""There's a lot of pressure in the House of Representatives to just emasculate the SNAP program. For whatever reason, some of these members of the House of Representatives get hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies. They think they earned that, and on the other hand, then they want to cut food stamps, and I think that's morally wrong."" We cannot read the minds of subsidy recipients, so we will not judge whether Congress members -- who earn $174,000 federal salaries -- think they have earned the right to farm subsidies. But Brown’s claim struck us as worth examining. Examples were easy to find. The Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an advocacy and research group, maintains a database of federal farm subsidies and has run lawmakers’ names to see what they or their families are getting. News organizations have used this database (and the public can, too), and some have noted where the recipients stand on food stamps, or SNAP. For instance: * Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, ""who supports billions of dollars in cuts to the food stamp program,"" is ""one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies, according to new annual data released by a Washington environmental group."" This was in the New York Times on May 22. Fincher, from Frog Jump, Tenn., and his wife ""collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012,"" reported the Times, using EWG data. In 2012 alone, the couple received about $70,000 in direct payments, which is ""money that is given to farmers and farmland owners, even if they do not grow crops,"" the Times wrote. During debate in May on whether to cut $20.5 billion from SNAP over the next 10 years, Fincher, a Republican, said, ""We have to remember there is not a big printing press in Washington that continually prints money over and over. This is other people’s money that Washington is appropriating and spending."" * Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California and his wife, Jill, together own one third of DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which in 2012 alone got $188,570 in direct farm payments from the federal government, according to the EWG. That would put last year’s subsidies to LaMalfa and his wife at $62,857. But going back to 1995, the DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership has received $5.13 million, which would put the share of Rep. LaMalfa and his wife at $1.7 million, EWG said. In May, LaMalfa won a House amendment that would require electronic fraud prevention measures and eliminate bonus pay for signing up new SNAP recipients. He said in a statement then, ""The success of the food stamp program should be measured by how many Americans become self-sufficient, not how many are added to the rolls."" * Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana has received $196,268 in farm subsidies since 1997, according to the EWG. Stutzman, a Republican, recently proposed cutting SNAP by $30 billion over 10 years, deeper than the $20.5 billion now on the table, saying, ""Everyone in Washington talks about deficit reduction but we’ve introduced a real, responsible plan to save taxpayer dollars. Over the past decade, SNAP spending has doubled as this program outgrows its original mission of providing temporary assistance."" The list goes on. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, both reviewing the same EWG data as other media, noted that 15 members of Congress got farm subsidies in 2012. (None were from Ohio.) Thirteen were Republicans and two were Democrats. The Democrats were in the Senate -- Michael Bennett of Colorado and Jon Tester of Montana, who says he is the Senate’s only ""working farmer."" Both voted June 10 for the Senate version of the farm bill, which would cut SNAP by $4 billion, or about $16 billion less than the House GOP leaders want. Brown, too, voted for the bill after failing to get the SNAP cut restored. It’s fairly obvious where this leaves Brown’s claim that some House members accepted ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" in farm subsidies but are eager to cut food stamps. But before ruling, we’ll note in fairness that some of the farm-subsidy recipients told the Wall Street Journal that the farm programs need reform, too. Fincher issued a statement saying, ""I voted immediately to remove direct payments,"" the Journal wrote. And, the Journal added, a spokesman for LaMalfa said the lawmaker has long opposed the farm-subsidy system and voted to end direct payments. In Stutzman’s case, the receipt of subsidies was a political issue in his 2010 election. But he maintained to the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette that the farm-support system is like a mandate, giving him no choice. The farmer ""has to take it,"" he told the Journal Gazette in 2010. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the program is voluntary. OK, so maybe he and the others didn’t like it one bit when they got farm subsidies. We’re not here to judge their motives. But we are here to judge Brown’s claim. It is True.",None,Sherrod Brown,None,None,None,2013-06-18T11:43:37,2013-06-12,['None']
271,pomt-03177,Americans spend more than $160 billion and 6 billion hours per year complying with the tax code.,true,/georgia/statements/2013/sep/04/tom-price/call-tax-overhaul-cites-high-cost-money-time/,"How much time did it take you -- or your tax preparer -- to complete your taxes last year? A couple of hours? A few days? How about 6 billion hours! According to Georgia Congressman Tom Price, Americans spend that vast amount of time complying with the tax code each year. Not only that, he said, but the cost to comply with the tax code is also astronomical. In a couple of Twitter posts recently, Price, a Republican from Roswell, used the eye-popping figures to push for an overhaul of the tax code. ""Americans spend $160+ billion per yr complying with the tax code. Visit http://TaxReform.gov & share your ideas to fix a broken tax code,"" one Price post said. It was followed by a second post:: ""Americans spend 6 billion hrs per yr complying with the tax code. Follow @simplertaxes & join the fight for a simpler, pro-growth tax code."" We know taxes and the federal tax code are tough and take time to understand. But 6 billion hours and $160 billion for compliance? Those numbers seemed extreme, and we decided to check them out. Tax reform has become a talking point that almost everyone can agree on, sort of like the declaration that ice cream is yummy. Politicos on both sides of the aisle have called for an overhaul of a tax system that many say is too complex and onerous for businesses and individuals. The broad goal is to simplify the code by eliminating or reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower tax rates across the board. Price is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, the chief tax-writing committee in the House. He has been part of a Republican bloc that has argued for overhauling the tax code to not only lower tax rates but also broaden the tax base and eliminate loopholes. To illustrate the obstacle that the tax code has become, Price and several other politicos have used the figures the congressman used in his Twitter posts. For example, PolitiFact Oregon checked similar statements made by U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who used the figures to promote his plan for simplifying the tax code. Wyden’s statement was rated True. The numbers cited by Price and Wyden can be traced to the Internal Revenue Service’s independent ombudsman, known as the National Taxpayer Advocate. The ombudsman, currently Nina E. Olson, is described as the voice of the taxpayer before the IRS and Congress. Olson leads the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, in helping taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS, as well as working for change in the agency and in the federal tax code. In a 2010 annual report to Congress, Olson said that taxpayers -- individuals and corporations -- spend about $163 billion annually to comply with the tax code, a sum equal to 11 percent of all the revenue the federal government collected. The cost of compliance was based on 2008 figures. The NTA says there is no correct methodology for quantifying the costs of compliance with the tax code. The $163 billion figure is based on what was spent on personal and business income taxes (5.6 billion hours) multiplied by the average hourly cost of a civilian employee ($29.18, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The calculations did not include time spent complying with requirements for employment, estate and gift, excise, and exempt organization taxes. The annual compliance cost estimate based on 2010 requirements grew to $168 billion, according to the NTA’s 2012 annual report. That 2012 annual report found that individual taxpayers and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with the filing requirements of the Internal Revenue code. That figure does not include millions of additional hours taxpayers spend responding to IRS notices or audits. Olson’s office arrived at that figure by multiplying the number of copies of each form filed for tax year 2010 by the average amount of time the IRS estimated it took to complete each form. The IRS estimates the average time burden for all taxpayers is 13 hours, with an average cost of $210 per return. This average includes four hours for actual tax form completion, six hours for recordkeeping, two more hours for tax planning and a miscellaneous hour. The authors of the NTA report admit that the figure for time spent complying with the tax code is difficult to accurately measure because the IRS has not kept up with technology improvements that have made the process more efficient. Since 2001, Olson’s office has found, Congress has made nearly 5,000 changes to the tax code, an average of more than one a day, and the code has reached almost 4 million words. ""Individual taxpayers find return preparation so overwhelming that few do it on their own. Nearly 60 percent of taxpayers hire paid preparers, and another 30 percent rely on commercial software, with leading software packages costing $50 or more,"" Olson wrote. ""In other words, taxpayers must spend money just to figure out how much money they owe."" If tax compliance were an industry, Olson said, ""it would be one of the largest in the United States."" To sum up, U.S. Rep Tom Price said Americans are spending more than $160 billion and 6 billion hours each year complying with the federal tax code. The figures have been repeated by multiple interests seeking a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code. Prices’ figures, used in two Twitter posts, can be traced to the IRS’ independent ombudsman. Those figures, while difficult to quantify, have become the accepted standard for calculating compliance time and costs.

Greg Abbott wrote, ""FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles,"" and supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011. PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., recently tackled a similar claim culled from Facebook: Obama was on the record supporting bans on certain semi-automatic rifles before his Jan. 16 speech, in which he again called for renewing the 1994-2004 federal ""assault weapons"" ban while urging education, mental health and other measures to reduce gun violence. Like Abbott’s tweet, the Facebook post cited the FBI. PolitiFact looked at the bureau’s annual report on ""Crime in the United States,"" a collection of data from local agencies on several categories of crimes. The Facebook post earned a ""True"" rating because it reflected the FBI’s statistics from 2011, the most recent year available, for murders with knives (1,694), personal weapons (728, typed on Facebook as 726), blunt objects (496) and rifles (323). The Facebook post did not include homicides the FBI attributed to handguns (6,220), firearms whose type was not stated (1,587) and ""other guns"" (97). Those numbers mean handguns were used in 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year. Abbott’s tweet, similarly, did not include some FBI-tracked categories by referring solely to rifles and blunt objects and leaving out other significant firearm categories. Still, according to the FBI’s data covering 2005 through 2011, blunt objects such as clubs and hammers were consistently used to murder more people than rifles alone. FBI homicide data 2005-2011, ranked in order of weapons used most often in 2011: Our ruling Like an older Facebook item, Abbott’s tweet uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. That said, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle. We rate his statement as True.

Santorum said, ""What we're seeing is a problem in our culture with respect to children being raised by children, children being raised out of wedlock, and the impact on society economically, the impact on society with respect to drug use and all -- a host of other things when children have children. … Two days ago on the front page of the New York Times, they're talking about the same thing. The bottom line is we have a problem in this country, and the family is fracturing. ""Over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock. How can a country survive if children are being raised in homes where it's so much harder to succeed economically? It's five times the rate of poverty in single-parent households than it is in two-parent homes. … We hear this all the time, cut spending, limit the government, everything will be fine. No, everything's not going to be fine."" Santorum touched on a lot of issues -- and essentially sidestepped the question from moderator John King, who had reminded him that ""you told an evangelical blog, if elected, you will talk about what, quote, 'no president has talked about before -- the dangers of contraception.' Why?"" For this item, we’ll focus on the main statistic he offered -- that ""over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock."" Simply put, he’s right. According to 2009 data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 41 percent of all births were to unmarried women. The percentage has risen steadily since at least 1980, the earliest year for which data was provided in the CDC report. In 1980, it stood at 18.4 percent. By 1990, it was 28.0 percent. And by 2000 it was 33.2 percent. ""It has been increasing over the last 50 years,"" said Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. While we’re on this topic, we’ll also look at an issue that Mitt Romney brought up later in the debate -- that ""among certain ethnic groups, the vast majority born out of wedlock."" This data is also included in the CDC report. In 2009, 17 percent of births to Asian-Pacific Islanders were out of wedlock, with non-Hispanic whites at 29 percent, 53 percent for Hispanics, 65 percent for American Indians and Native Alaskans and 73 percent for non-Hispanic blacks. So Romney’s claim would be accurate at least for American Indians and non-Hispanic blacks. Meanwhile, within age groups, unmarried births accounted for 87 percent of those to teenagers and 62 percent of births to women age 20 to 24. About 20 percent of births to women age 30 and over were to unmarried mothers. But births to unmarried teens as a percentage of all unmarried births has declined. Unmarried teen births (those to mothers from age 15 to 19) represented 21 percent of all unmarried births, which is far lower than the rate in 1970, which was 49 percent. Our ruling Federal data backs up Santorum’s contention that ""over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock."" In fact, the number for 2009, the most recent available, is a record high, based on the data included in the federal report.

Chris Christie has ignited talk about Christie’s 2016 presidential prospects. In his victory speech, Christie, eyes straight at the camera, invited the rest of the country to see what a Republican could achieve in New Jersey. Conservative pundit George Will said the prospect of flipping a blue state could be Christie’s trump card if he does decide to run for president. ""He will turn to the Republicans now and say, ‘Your problem is the 18 states and the District of Columbia that have voted democratic in six consecutive presidential elections,’"" Will said on Fox News Sunday. ""Those 18 states, which include New Jersey by the way, have 242 electoral votes. If the Democratic presidential nominee can assume those states, he or she will spend the autumn of 2016 looking for 28 electoral votes, and he or she will find them."" It’s a simple matter of going to the electoral college record to see if Will has his numbers right, and he does. While about one third of the states have moved from one party to the other over the past 24 years, Democrats have been able to hold on to a larger number than Republicans. More importantly, the Democratic states have bigger populations and thus deliver more electoral votes. Democrats can count on the two big prizes of California and New York, while Republicans can counter with just one super-sized state, Texas. The average state in the blue column delivers 13 electoral votes; the average on the red side is 8.

A recent commentary in Red State, a self-described right-of-center website, suggested the problem is even worse than Will said. ""After totaling the electoral votes in all the solid blue states, it becomes apparent that even a below average Democrat presidential candidate could begin the race with a whopping 246 advantage,"" the author said. ""No wonder President (Barack) Obama was so confident of victory in 2012 for he knew the game was practically over before it began."" University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said the hurdle for Republicans doesn't look any better if you count the underlying votes by citizens, not just the electoral results.

Among those who voted ""nay"" -- that is, those who wanted to keep it under consideration -- was Brown, then representing Massachusetts in the Senate. He also co-sponsored a predecessor measure, S.1467, the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act of 2011. So Shaheen’s camp is correct that Brown acted in support of this measure. But what did the amendment say? It acted to widen the scope of acceptable actions for opting out of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on religious or moral grounds. It focuses on mandates within the law for preventive services, called the ""essential health benefits package."" Specifically, the amendment said employers cannot be required to cover ""specific items or services"" that are ""contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering the plan."" We agree with the Shaheen campaign that the provision is drawn broadly. While it’s not targeted at abortion or birth control per se, it is so expansively written that there’s little doubt it could be invoked on behalf of those who oppose abortion and certain types of birth control. As we explained in our other fact check, we find no evidence that anyone has expressed a religious or moral objection to mammograms, so we rated that claim Mostly False. But the case that the Blunt Amendment would have affected access to birth control is stronger. Some opponents of abortion have supported opt-out rights for employers who oppose certain types of birth control that they say work like abortifacients. In fact, this was the issue at the heart of the closely watched 2014 Supreme Court decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby. In that case, a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. The only quibble we have with the phrasing of Shaheen’s claim is that the Blunt Amendment didn’t single out birth control, which is the impression one could easily get from her statement. But since the amendment was written so broadly -- and since birth control has long been at issue for religious or moral reasons -- we don’t see this as a significant problem. Our ruling Shaheen said Brown ""co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control."" The amendment, which Brown supported, was written loosely enough to allow a religious-conscience opt-out for birth control -- an issue about which there has been a longstanding policy debate on religious and moral grounds.

276,pomt-07515,"In Florida, it’s not illegal for an immediate family member of state officials to prosper from legislation supported by a spouse.",true,/florida/statements/2011/apr/08/broward-county-medical-association/group-claims-it-not-illegal-florida-spouse-benefit/,"From appointing state health agency heads to proposing how much funding state-run health care programs should receive, Gov. Rick Scott has some major influence over the state's medical industry. It's that influence coupled with Scott's former business dealings in health care that has at least one group of Florida physicians concerned that Scott could potentially peddle legislation that would benefit a fast-growing urgent-care clinic company he co-founded. On March 31, 2011, the board of directors of the Broward County Medical Association convened for its monthly meeting, where one of the items up for discussion was how Scott's position might benefit Solantic Corp. -- a chain of 32 walk-in clinics Scott helped found in 2001. Before taking office in January 2011, Scott transferred his $62 million worth of shares in the company into a trust under his wife's name. Scott said that by doing so, he was free of any future conflicts of interest. ""As I've told you, I'm not involved in that company,"" Scott was quoted as saying in the St. Petersburg Times in an April 2, 2011, article about why he didn't sell his shares instead. Still, for the 20-member board of the Broward Medical Association, Scott handing over his shares to his wife did not address concerns that his actions as governor could potentially benefit Solantic. So the board unanimously agreed to issue a resolution. ""It is a conflict of interest for the governor (or any government official) to have his immediate family own urgent-care centers or clinics and for them to benefit financially from government health care reform,"" read the resolution, according to an e-mail provided by the group's president, Dr. Aaron Elkin. The association represents 1,500 allopathic and osteopathic physicians of all specialties, according to its website. The association then sent out notice of the resolution with the following statement: ""Gov. Scott transferred his ownership interest in Solantic to a trust owned and managed by his wife. Solantic has contracts with Medicaid HMOs. Their volume of patients will likely increase if/when Medicaid Reform is expanded statewide. Gov. Scott's wife sits on the Solantic board. Florida is one of the few states where that arrangement (an immediate family member may prosper from legislation supported by their spouse) is not illegal."" We wondered if the last part of the statement was true. Does Florida have no laws banning a state officer from supporting legislation that would benefit an immediate family member? What Florida law says First, we turned to Florida statutes and the Florida Commission on Ethics to see what the law spells out in cases where an immediate family member’s finances could potentially cause a conflict of interest. Kerrie Stillman, spokeswoman for the Florida Commission on Ethics, said she couldn't comment on Scott's potential conflict of interest but directed us to the provisions of the law that might be relevant. The issue of ""misuse of public position"" is addressed in Florida Statute 112.313. The law reads: ""No public officer...shall corruptly use or attempt to use his or her official position or any property or resource which may be within his or her trust, or perform his or her official duties, to secure a special privilege, benefit, or exemption for himself, herself, or others."" When it comes to business dealings, the same statute says that a public officer shall not ""either directly or indirectly purchase, rent, or lease any realty, goods, or services for his or her own agency from any business entity"" in which the officer, his or her spouse or child is an officer, partner, director or proprietor or has a ""material interest."" As long as Solantic is not doing business directly with the governor's office, then Scott is technically not violating those provisions, said Mark Herron, a Tallahassee attorney specializing in ethics and government affairs. Herron also previously served on the Florida Commission on Ethics. ""His agency is the Executive Office of the Governor, it’s not the Agency for Health Care Administration, the Department of Health, the Department of Elder Affairs, etc.,"" Herron said. ""From a strict reading of those provisions, he doesn’t have any conflicting interests as long as Solantic is not doing business with the Executive Office of the Governor."" While Scott does not have a vote in legislative matters -- only the ability to propose or veto legislation -- it's worth noting that even other state lawmakers can still vote on an issue, even if there is a potential conflict of interest. Florida Statute 112.3143 provides that ""no state public officer is prohibited from voting in an official capacity on any matter."" The statute goes on to clarify that should there be a potential conflict of interest, such as a ""special private gain or loss of a relative or business associate,"" the elected official has 15 days after the vote occurs to ""disclose the nature of his or her interest as a public record in a memorandum file filed with the person responsible for recording the minutes of the meeting."" In contrast, on the municipal and county level, the same statute gives a different set of instructions. Should a conflict of interest arise, officials have to abstain from voting on the measure, and publicly announce at the meeting why they aren't voting. They also have 15 days to file a memorandum with the clerk or whoever is recording meeting minutes. Herron said that when the state’s initial ethics laws were passed in 1975, both local and state governments were held to the same standard. But the provisions for municipal and county officials were changed in 1984 because lawmakers felt local elected officials have more day-to-day dealings with approving and entering into contracts. A measure working its way through the Legislature this year seeks to hold all state officers to the same standard as local and county officials when it comes to voting on items where there may be conflicts of interest. Blind trusts The issue of where to place a governor's financial holdings to avoid a potential conflict of interest has been around long before Scott -- whose reported net worth is $218 million -- took office. During two terms as governor, Jeb Bush, whose net worth coming into office was close to $2 million, held his assets in a blind trust, according to the St. Petersburg Times. A blind trust is one in which the owner hands over power of attorney to someone else, and has no right to intervene in the holdings of the trust. Gov. Charlie Crist likewise placed his assets in a revocable trust, according to the Times. That's similar to a blind trust in that you’re handing over the daily decisions about assets to someone else, but there is still an opportunity to chime in on the management of the assets. For the 2011 legislative session, Republican Sen. Mike Fasano has revived a bill he first sponsored in 2007 that would require the governor and other elected officials to place their financial assets in a blind trust. We called Scott's office to get his take on the concerns that, by transferring his Solantic shares to his wife’s trust, he had not eliminated the potential for a conflict of interest, but we did not hear back. Still, when Scott was pressed again on the subject of potential conflicts of interest with Solantic at an economic forum in West Palm Beach on April 4, 2011, he told the Palm Beach Post: ""That company will not be doing business with the state, and I've told everybody all along, hold me accountable for that."" However, even if Solantic does not do business with the state in an official capacity, the company can still accept payments through state workers compensation programs and Medicaid HMO plans. For example, people covered by state-run programs may visit a Solantic clinic as a personal decision. According to figures provided by Solantic CEO Karen Bowling to the Palm Beach Post and St. Petersburg Times, the company received $110,657 from the state in 2010, and $20,061 so far in 2011 -- mainly for providing employment-related physicals and workers' compensation cases. ""Even when we cast the governor's actions in the best light possible and presume his compliance with the relevant Florida voting conflict and disclosure of financial interests statutes, his indirect but real financial interests in the current trust creates an appearance of impropriety from a reasonably objective public perspective,"" said Tony Alfieri, director of the Center for Ethics and Public Service at the University of Miami School of Law. Our ruling The medical association's resolution criticizes Scott for a conflict of interest, but its e-mail announcing the resolution concedes it is not illegal in Florida for an immediate family member of a state officer to prosper from legislation supported by their spouse. So back to our question: Is it legal? Provisions in Chapter 112 of the Florida Statutes allow state lawmakers to vote on issues that might benefit family members so long as they disclose the relationship after the vote. Scott may propose health-care legislation and budgets and appoint health-care officials, but he's not a lawmaker. Solantic clinics benefit from doing routine medical work paid for through state programs, such as Medicaid or workers' comp exams, but Scott has said repeatedly that Solantic will not officially do business with the state. ""From the point of view of complying with the strict definition of the law, he appears not to have violated any of the provisions,"" Herron said. ""But, as everyone has noted, there may be a higher standard than a legal standard to be held to."" The legal standard is the one we're fact-checking.

277,pomt-01685,"Says Charlie Crist rode on a jet that ""belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water.""",true,/florida/statements/2014/aug/15/republican-party-florida/charlie-crist-used-jet-owned-serial-polluter-rpof-/,"Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign has focused on painting the Republican incumbent as a friend of the environment, which means attempting to show Democratic challenger Charlie Crist isn’t. A Republican Party of Florida commercial released Aug. 7, 2014, lambasts Crist for taking a supporter’s personal aircraft to a press event. ""On his way to an event about -- get this -- green issues, Crist cruised in on a private jet,"" the narrator says. ""That’s rich. What’s richer? The jet belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water."" That certainly sounded like fodder for headlines, but was it true? PolitiFact Florida attempted to pull the permits on this one and find out what happened. Campaign development The state GOP told PolitiFact the commercial stemmed from a plane ride Crist took from Gainesville to Tallahassee on July 25. While Scott uses his personal jet to attend events and has been criticized for a lack of transparency surrounding its use, Crist has often used private planes to help him get to events around the state. This time the Scott campaign took a photo of the 2005 Cessna 560XL’s tail number and traced its ownership. The owner turned out to be James Finch, a Lynn Haven contractor who owns Phoenix Construction Services Inc., a company previously fined for environmental infractions. That was especially problematic for the flight in question, since Crist was attending a climate change lecture by Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton. Finch, a former NASCAR team owner, has a long history of political donations, giving tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party of Florida and John McCain’s presidential campaign. He also has a history of facing fines from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. While neither agency responded to PolitiFact Florida’s requests for documentation of Finch’s penalties, we were able to do a little digging on our own. On two occasions, in 1984 and 1996, he was cited for backfilling the bayou at his home. No action was taken on the first instance, but he was forced to pay a penalty and do restoration work on the second. A 1998 complaint about destruction of seagrass and another notice about a potential sewage spill at a Millville wastewater treatment plant were withdrawn for lack of evidence. His company Phoenix Construction Services was fined $23,000 by the EPA after filling in wetlands at a Panama Beach park against the terms of the project’s U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit in 1999. Fill dirt is considered by law to be a pollutant in ""navigable wetlands."" The Army Corps of Engineers issued a noncompliance notice after the company installed a portion of a sewage pipeline across St. Andrew Bay above ground against permitting guidelines. Finch’s company was cleared when the work was corrected per DEP guidelines by 2005. The truly epic saga, however, was Phoenix’s botched work at the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, which opened north of Panama City in 2010. Crist in 2007 called the airport ""a national model for economic transformation and environmental preservation."" Environmental groups had complained in 2009 that because of poor construction methods, the site was resulting in ""pollution in Burnt Mill Creek, Crooked Creek, West Bay and the surrounding wetlands."" Later that year, Phoenix was fined $1.7 million by the DEP for environmental permit violations. The agency concluded the contractor did not follow stormwater runoff plans or erosion stabilization methods, allowing improperly filtered water to flow into nearby wetlands. As costs wildly overran, Phoenix and the airport authority first sued each other, then banded together to sue other parties working on the project before settling in 2012. Phoenix did not return PolitiFact Florida’s request for comment. Phoenix continued to do work for the local government, though. The Bay County Commission in 2013 gave Phoenix a $25 million contract to build the county a water pumping station. The Crist campaign said the former governor didn’t know about the environmental fines against Finch. They said Crist hasn't used the plane since July 27. The Scott campaign shouldn't be too quick to point fingers at Finch for pollution fines, however. Finch worked on the airport with Charles W. ""Chuck"" Roberts III, a Panhandle paving contractor whose company was accused of improperly building a parking lot in that project. The airport authority was eventually blamed for not securing the proper permit. C.W. Roberts Inc. plants in several counties have been cited for leaking or improperly storing chemicals or being in disrepair. Many of the company’s infractions did not result in penalties. What is Roberts doing now? In 2011, Gov. Scott appointed him to a seat on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Crist rode on a jet that ""belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water."" The plane’s owner, Bay County contractor James Finch, has been fined in the past for filling in wetlands or allowing unfiltered runoff to flow into waterways, in violation of environmental permits. That’s a legitimate definition of polluting, and there’s no doubt Finch has been fined almost $2 million over the years. It’s hypocritical of the state GOP to call out Finch when one of his subcontractors has benefited from a relationship with Gov. Scott. But that doesn’t change the facts.

278,pomt-07380,"""You’ve got each day 10,000 new seniors, baby boomers, becoming eligible for the entitlement programs.""",true,/virginia/statements/2011/may/04/eric-cantor/rep-eric-cantor-says-10000-baby-boomers-day-are-be/,"Amid the pop of champagne at the start of 2011, you many not have noticed the beginnings of a monumental event that will reshape America. The first baby boomers turned 65. Every day this year, and for the next 18 years, multitudes more will turn 65 and begin to rely on the nation’s already-stressed entitlement programs. Baby boomers are Americans born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Dec. 31, 1964. Their 65th birthdays mark the beginning of eligibility for Medicare and fall one year before their full qualification for Social Security. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been blanketing cable networks to promote the House GOP budget and the need for major spending cuts. His effort comes as Congress and the president grapple with both the 2012 federal budget and more immediate need to raise the debt ceiling. Appearing on CNBC April 27, Cantor, R-Va., said ""you’ve got each day 10,000 new seniors, baby boomers, becoming eligible for the entitlement programs. Ten thousand a day."" Is Cantor’s number right? We asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor’s press secretary, where the congressman came up with the figure of 10,000 seniors a day becoming eligible for entitlements. She pointed us to a series of statements and reports by the Social Security Administration. In October 2007, when the first baby boomer claimed early retirement benefits from Social Security, the agency put out a press release. Kathleen Casey-Kirschling, born one second after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946, qualified for payments in January 2008, the agency said, adding that ""over the next two decades, nearly 80 million Americans will become eligible for Social Security benefits, more than 10,000 per day."" Social Security allows recipients to start claiming benefits at age 62, though that means accepting a lower monthly payout. The full retirement age for boomers born in 1954 or earlier is 66. It then increases by two months in each of the next six birth years, with everyone born 1960 or later getting full benefits at age 67. Retirees can choose to defer payments up until they’re 70, receiving a larger monthly check in return. The Social Security agency also referred to the 10,000-a-day statistic in its report for fiscal 2012. The Pew Research Center highlighted the statistic in a 2010 study on baby boomers. According to Census data gathered by Pew, 76 million people were born in the United States during the generation. After subtracting those who have already died and adding immigrants born during those years, the Census estimates there are roughly 79.6 million people aged 45 to 64 in America. If you divide 79.6 million by 19 years, then divide that by 365 days, you get 11,478. That’s the number of people, on average, who will turn 65 each day for the next 19 years. Obviously not everyone in that category will live to 65, but the math clearly gives you a figure above the 10,000-a-day cited by Cantor. We also checked the Social Security awards given in 2010. According to the SSA, 4.05 million retired workers or survivors of deceased workers started getting payments last year. That means 11,102 people each day began receiving checks. In 2009 the number was slightly higher, at 11,436 per day. Right now, about 8,600 people a day enter Social Security through the traditional retirement program, and another 3,000 each day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers. If the head count climbs up to 11,400 per day through the traditional program, plus another 3,000 per day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers, that’s almost a 25 percent increase in the number of Social Security beneficiaries. And consider this: In 1950, as Social Security ramped up, there were 16 workers per recipient. Today there are 2.9 workers per recipient, and by 2041 the SSA says there will be just 2.1 workers per recipient. Let’s review. Rep. Eric Cantor said 10,000 Americans per day become eligible for entitlement programs, meaning Social Security and Medicare. His number are borne out in projections and data from the Social Security Administration. During 2009 and 2010 ,the number of Social Security recipients was actually above 11,000 per day, though many of those people were not retirees. Census data show nearly 80 million baby boomers, born over a span of 19 years. They will turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare at a rate of 11,478 per day. In fact, as of May 3 an estimated 1.4 million people have turned 65 this year. The numbers are staggering.

279,pomt-07891,"Under Hosni Mubarak's rule, ""Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel.""",true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/ross-douthat/egypt-got-more-foreign-aid-anyone-besides-israel-s/,"Hosni Mubarak may have ruled Egypt with an iron fist since 1981, but he's been an important ally for the United States in the fight against terrorism -- or so the thinking goes. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, though, questioned whether Mubarak has been as helpful as some believe. Mubarak, after all, led a regime that tortured political dissidents. ""By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country's Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri — Osama bin Laden's chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda — out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad,"" Douthat wrote. Douthat credited the book The Looming Tower, by Lawrence Wright, for documenting that history. ""At the same time, Mubarak's relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview,"" Douthat wrote. ""Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it's been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States."" Douthat concluded his column by noting that a different government in Egypt might not necessarily be a good thing. ""The long-term consequences of a more populist and nationalistic Egypt might be better for the United States than the stasis of the Mubarak era, and the terrorism that it helped inspire. But then again they might be worse. There are devils behind every door,"" he wrote. We were interested in Douthat's statement about aid to Egypt. He is correct based on the most recent statistics. If you don't count Afghanistan ($8.9 billion) and Iraq ($7.5 billion) because of the ongoing U.S. military operations, then Israel ($2.4 billion) is indeed the top recipient, followed by Egypt ($1.5 billion). That's followed by Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). We found these ratings in the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract, which compiled 2008 military and economic aid. Foreign aid includes things such as money for economic development, agriculture or children's health. In Egypt's case, most of the money in recent years has gone to military aid, particularly heavy equipment such as tanks, helicopters and fighter planes. We should note that Egypt will likely slip a place when the official 2010 figures are released, according to a report in the Boston Globe. Haiti is expected to receive more aid, because of the earthquake that occurred there in 2010. The Globe also reported that much of the aid the U.S. sends to Egypt comes back to the United States when Egypt purchases weapons from U.S. defense manufacturers. Still, Douthat wrote that Egypt has received more money than any country besides Israel ""under his rule."" That would mean the 30 years since Mubarak came to power in late 1981. We turned to the same source the Statistical Abstract used, the U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants data as collected in the ""Greenbook."" The Greenbook, which is compiled by the U.S. Agency for International Development, provides ""a complete historical record of United States' (U.S.) foreign aid to the rest of the world by reporting all loans and grants authorized by the U.S. Government for each fiscal year,"" according to its site. We obtained aid data by country, calculated in inflation-adjusted 2009 U.S. dollars, from 1982 to 2009. This time, Israel ($117.6 billion) was number one, followed by Egypt ($83.7 billion) at number two. Rounding out the top 10 were Iraq ($54.4 billion), Afghanistan ($35.2 billion), Russia ($18.1 billion), Pakistan ($18 billion), Turkey ($16.7 billion), Jordan ($11.2 billion), Sudan ($10.3 billion), and Colombia ($10.3 billion).
