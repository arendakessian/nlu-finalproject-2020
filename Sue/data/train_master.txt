1122	94	a	"In 2010, then-Congressman Nathan Deal unveiled a series of education initiatives he pledged to enact if voters would sign off on his plans for a job change and elect him Georgia’s 82nd governor. Among them was the promise that teachers would have a big financial incentive to work in bad schools. ""Teachers who agree to dedicate their time in one of our state's most underperforming schools would further be rewarded by accruing service credit at twice the rate, earning two years of credit for each calendar year served,” Deal said in a press release dated Sept. 7, 2010. At that time, 503, or 22.6 percent, of the state’s 2,221 public schools were failing to make adequate yearly progress, the measure of achievement under the federal No Child Left Behind law. We checked in with some in-the-know education advocates to see whether they’d heard of any action on this Deal campaign promise. None had. “That’s a campaign promise that probably fell victim to a comfortable electoral margin,” one said. We went to Deal’s re-election campaign and spokeswoman Jennifer Talaber with some basic questions. Has the governor taken any steps to see whether this could become a reality or is feasible? Has he gotten any projections on the potential costs? Is he still pursuing this? In one of several email exchanges that followed, Talaber said: “It’s still a goal.” But other things had to come first, she said. “In order to enact any merit-based incentives, we first had to fix the flawed (teacher) evaluation system which, when Deal came to office in 2011, was rating 99 percent of teachers as ‘satisfactory’,” Talaber said. “We did that in 2013.” The new evaluation system will be fully implemented during the 2014-2015 school year, she said. “Once that groundwork is laid, we can begin pursuing new initiatives,” Talaber said. Deal’s plan would allow teachers to earn two years of credit toward retirement for every one year they work in one of the state’s most underperforming schools, the spokeswoman said. No study has been done to determine the costs, Talaber said. Under the Teacher Retirement System of Georgia, a teacher who retires with 30 years of service can draw about 60 percent of the average of his or her highest two consecutive years of pay. Some districts also offer their teachers a local pension or allow them to participate in Social Security. As of May 31, the state’s teacher retirement system had 214,567 active members and 104,091 retired members. The system paid out more than $3.5 billion in fiscal 2013 and expects to pay out $3.7 billion for the year ending June 30, said Jeff Ezell, the system’s executive director. Deal “remains committed to improving the quality of students’ education and rewarding Georgia’s most effective teachers,” Talaber said."

1595	96	a	"Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country.”	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/02/mary-n/norwood-says-georgia-has-most-restrictive-ballot-a/	Mary Norwood often said during last year’s unsuccessful run for Atlanta mayor that she was not red or blue, but purple. In other words, Norwood claimed she was not a strict disciple of either the Democratic or the Republican parties. So when Norwood jumped into the race earlier this year for Fulton County Commission chairman, she decided to run as an independent. So far, her toughest battle is not with the incumbent, John Eaves, but getting on the Nov. 2 ballot. “Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country,” Norwood, a former two-term Atlanta city councilwoman, said during a television interview Tuesday evening. That claim was too juicy for PolitiFact Georgia to resist checking out. We began by asking the Norwood camp for details. Anne Fauver, her campaign manager, explained. Georgia requires independent candidates running for countywide offices to get at least 5 percent of all registered voters eligible to vote in the last election in that jurisdiction to sign a petition supporting their placement on the ballot. “I didn’t know how restrictive it was in comparison to other states,” said Fauver, who served with Norwood on the City Council. Norwood needs about 22,700 signatures to get on the ballot. Thus far, she is “more than halfway” to her goal, Fauver said. Norwood has until July 13 to reach the magic number. Norwood has taken Eaves to court over what she calls a “hypertechnical interpretation” of the law to discount about 3,000 of the signatures she has collected. The Eaves campaign says each petition signer must write “Fulton,” along with their address, on the form. Norwood says Fulton election officials told her she could pre-type “Fulton” on the form. A judge dismissed Norwood’s complaint on this point Thursday, saying, in part, that any ruling before the deadline “would constitute an advisory opinion.” As for the 5 percent rule, we reached out to Richard Winger, the California-based editor of Ballot Access News. He has studied ballot issues for more than four decades. Winger was called a “savant” on the topic by Columbia University professor Nate Persily and “the nation’s encyclopedia on this stuff” by Capital University Law School professor Bradley Smith. “That is the toughest such law in the country,” Winger said of Georgia. Until 1943, any political party could gain across-the-board ballot access by registering a slate of officers with the secretary of state. State leaders changed the system that year, primarily to discourage Communist Party candidates from getting on the ballot, Winger said. Some Southern states also used such rules to ensure that a white candidate would win, Smith said. The laws gradually changed over the years for some offices, Winger said. Statewide independent candidates now need the signatures of 1 percent of registered voters to get on the ballot. The rules stayed the same for independent candidates seeking a municipal or countywide office, or seats in Congress or the Georgia Legislature. Why hasn’t the law changed? For some reason, Winger said, state lawmakers couldn’t agree in the 1980s on several proposed bills that would have made it easier for people to get on the ballot to potentially run against them. A bill that would have removed the requirement that independent candidates gather signatures on a petition to run for office did not pass earlier this year. Winger ranks North Carolina as having the second-most-restrictive ballot access guidelines for independent countywide candidates. The Tar Heel State requires those candidates to get the signatures of 4 percent of registered voters in the county to get on the ballot. Winger ranked Illinois as third, but it’s worth noting that state also requires independent countywide candidates to get 5 percent of the signatures of voters who cast ballots in the 2008 election. As for her claim on Georgia’s rules about ballot access, the Peach State and Illinois both have similar ballot access guidelines. Therefore, we rate Norwood’s statement as True.

2252	9	a	"As a state rep, I was considered the fourth-most conservative in the Legislature.”	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/01/rick-green/green-says-he-was-fouth-most-conservative-texas-ho/	Rick Green of Dripping Springs, in an April 13 Republican primary runoff for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court, told a Montgomery County group that voters don’t have to guess his judicial philosophy -- they can look at his legislative voting record. Green served two terms in the Texas House from 1999 to 2003; he lost his seat in 2002 to Democrat Patrick Rose. According to a video of his Jan. 14 Montgomery County remarks posted on his campaign Web site, Green encouraged listeners to check his House history, saying: As a state rep, I was considered the fourth-most conservative in the Legislature.” Is that so? To support his claim, Green's campaign pointed us to the 1999 Texas Conservative Report, a publication of the Free Enterprise PAC, an advocate for limited government and ""traditional values."" It has since become the Heritage Alliance PAC. The 1999 report tracks dozens of votes made by every legislator in that year's regular session. To evaluate House members, a panel chose 64 votes on ""economic, social, governmental and education issues"" that the group said “showed signs of a liberal or conservative philosophy.” Lawmakers were graded based on the number of times they voted with the conservative position. Green and two other members of the 150-member House voted the group's preferred way 88 percent of the time; only three members leaned the group's way more often. (The average score was 43 percent.) By that measure, Green shared the “fourth-most conservative” honors with GOP Reps. John Davis of Houston and Charlie Howard of Sugar Land. Senators were rated separately, leaving Green's statement open to interpretation whether he was claiming to be the fourth-most conservative in the whole Legislature (which would be an overstatement) or just the House (which was accurate). The report lists 28 criteria that define how positions were identified as conservative, including if legislation made government more efficient, strengthened the family's importance as the foundation of the nation, reduced the overall tax burden or protected a citizen's ability to make a living. In summarizing its ratings, the group highlighted 12 votes on topics ranging from property taxes to abortion to standardized testing. One vote was on a bill that would have expanded the state's hate crimes law by, among other things, enhancing criminal penalties and specifying which groups would be protected against bias crimes, including those targeted because of their ""race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, status as a pregnant person, gender, or sexual preference."" The Free Enterprise PAC said ""nay"" was the conservative vote in this case because the measure would have given ""special rights to an individual or group"" and did not support ""traditional Judeo/Christian moral values."" Green was in the minority in voting no. That bill eventually failed, though a hate crimes measure later passed into law during the 2001 legislative session. Green also received a thumbs-up from the group for voting against a bill requiring people younger than 18 to wear a bicycle helmet when riding on public roads or paths. That measure did not become law. All in all, Green was one of 32 House members the group designated a Leader of Excellence in 1999. Not noted by Green in Montgomery County: Based on some of his votes in the 2001 legislative session -- Green's last -- he slipped in the group's conservative rankings. Not that Green became a liberal. The group's 2001 report states that Green took its favored position 65 percent of the time, compared to a House average of 34 percent. He tied with three others as the 11th-most conservative House member. Thirty members sided more often with the group's preferred positions. Green, who served on Heritage Alliance's board of directors from March through November 2009, was not designated a Leader of Excellence by the group in 2001 because he sided with it in less than 70 percent of the rated votes. As before, the group's 2001 report spotlights 12 votes, which covered topics ranging from the death penalty to the minimum wage to mental illness. The votes included two that the group penalized Green for, both voice votes, in which passage is determined by choruses of ""ayes"" and ""nays"" on the House floor. The first was on a proposal to mandate that health insurance policies in Texas cover anorexia and bulimia as serious mental illnesses, and the second was on a bill requiring the state attorney general's office to use gender-neutral terminology in publications. Neither became law. For both, the group's preferred position was to oppose them. When we asked Heritage Alliance President Richard Ford how the group was able to tell tell whether a legislator had voted yes or no in those instances, he said he could not recall how those votes were treated because the report was done so long ago. We have a hunch why the group marked Green as voting the wrong way on the two bills. After a voice vote is held, individual members may request that their vote be separately recorded as for or against. It appears that Free Enterprise gave conservative credit only to the lawmakers who did that on those two measures, and Green was not one of them, according to the House Journal. His wife, Kara Green, the campaign's treasurer, said her husband did not support either measure. Summing up: Green accurately recaps his conservative ranking — albeit by a single group, the Free Enterprise PAC, during his first of two terms. He omits the fact that he was not considered fourth-most conservative in his second term, according to the group. We rate his statement as Half True."

Barack Obama asserted that abortions have not gone down'' in the United States during the presidency of George W. Bush, a strong abortion opponent. ""I believe in Roe vs. Wade , and I come to that conclusion not because I'm proabortion, but because, ultimately, I don't think women make these decisions casually. I think they — they wrestle with these things in profound ways, in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members,"" Obama said. ""And so, for me, the goal right now should be — and this is where I think we can find common ground. And by the way, I've now inserted this into the Democratic Party platform, is how do we reduce the number of abortions? The fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address."" But Obama's statement is directly contradicted by statistics that show legal abortions have fallen since the start of the 21st century. The New York-based Guttmacher Institute reported in January 2008 that in 2005 the country's abortion rate fell to 19.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, continuing a trend that started after the abortion rate peaked in 1981 at 29.3. The institute, a think tank on reproductive health issues, reported that the number of abortions also fell, to 1.2-million in 2005, which it said was 25 percent below the record high of 1.6-million abortions in 1990. And the federal Centers for Disease Control reported in its latest Abortion Surveillance Report that in 2004 there were 839,226 legal abortions, down 1.1 percent from 2003. The abortion ratio of 16 per 1,000 women has been the same since 2000, it added. Rebecca Wind, spokesman of the Guttmacher Institute, said the difference in the two sets of numbers reflects differences in data collection. She said the CDC relies on state health departments, and not all states require abortion statistics reporting. Guttmacher does its own survey of all legal abortion providers and reports a fairly high response rate. In any case, she added, ""There's no way to spin this one. The abortion rate is at its lowest rate since 1974.'' Obama made his comments to Warren in the context of cutting the number of abortions. He said he wanted to find ""ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions.'' In that context, his comment about abortions made sense. Guttmacher data showed that 49 percent of pregnancies were unintended in 2001, unchanged from 1994. Obama's campaign did not respond to an e-mail seeking an explanation for the senator's statement. But his comment about the abortion rate was wrong, so we rule this claim False."

This will be a government-supported nonprofit corporation, similar to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, that will use federal seed money to leverage private sector funding to improve local innovation, test the impact of new ideas and expand successful programs to scale. The fund will operate through a network of funds that will be rooted in the private sector at the community level, with local decision-making informed by a shared network of best practices. For example, a successful nonprofit organization could apply for funding to study ways to improve or expand the organization to other locations. Or an angel investor could work with the fund to identify high-quality nonprofits that should be expanded to other locations and invest in that expansion. The network of funds would bring experts skilled at analyzing data, picking winners, measuring results, and building capacity to work.

2922	12	a	Gov. Mark Dayton gave a late-season State of the State address this week. In it, he highlighted some of the bright spots in Minnesota’s economic, education and health outlook as evidence that changes made during his tenure are making the state better. PoliGraph looked at three of those statements this week. “There are more than 2.8 million jobs in Minnesota today. More jobs than ever before in our state’s history. 150,000 more jobs than when I became governor.” Using seasonally adjusted Department of Employment and Economic Development data going back to 1990, Dayton’s claim checks out: There are roughly 2.81 jobs in Minnesota today, and that’s more than the state has seen in recent history. It’s also true that there are about 151,000 more jobs today than when Dayton took office in January 2011. Of course, it’s important to put these numbers in context. The nation as a whole has been recovering from the recession for several years now. According to DEED, Minnesota went into the recession earlier than the nation and came out of it a bit earlier, too. Since then, the state’s growth has essentially tracked the nation’s growth. “Our graduation rate, nearly 80 percent, is the highest in a decade.” According to data from the Department of Education, 79.5 percent of seniors graduated in 2013 up from about 77 percent the year before “This increase is twice the yearly increase seen over the past three years, showing acceleration in progress for Minnesota seniors,” the education department said when it released the numbers. Minnesota’s graduation rate is among the highest in the nation. In fact, graduation rates everywhere are on the rise, particularly among Hispanic and African American kids. However, when it comes to graduating lower income kids, Minnesota’s rate is on the low side compared to other states – about 58 percent, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Education. “We have the fifth lowest percentage of citizens without health insurance coverage.”

Anchor Jenna Lee asked: How would you deal with China, especially with our economic ties right now? I mean, what's the way forward?"" West replied: ""Well, I think that that is one of the key things that we need to be talking about, when we look at the debt that we have and China owns about 29 percent of that debt."" West linked to the interview on his website. Is West's figure right -- does China own about 29 percent of the U.S. debt? We asked spokeswoman Angela Sachitano for an explanation. She sent us back a link to a March 25, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service titled ""Foreign Holdings of Federal Debt."" Note the word ""foreign."" Table 2 shows the top 10 ""foreign holders"" of federal debt, and Mainland China is at the top, with about $1.16 trillion or 26.1 percent (Japan is No. 2). This means China holds about 26 percent of ""foreign investment in U.S. privately held federal debt,"" the report states. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia weighed in on a similar claim by Herman Cain, a Republican presidential candidate, who spoke about China's share of the U.S. debt at a tea party event in Iowa on April 16. We rated Cain's claim False. ""If we don't begin to grow with the potential that we have in this country, we will have another national security crisis, and that national security crisis is that China will be as big as we are,"" Cain said. ""They'll start to develop a military as big and as good as ours, and they've got a billion more people and they're holding 26 percent of our debt. And you think we're going to be able to sing Kumbaya with them?"" After examining a U.S. Treasury Department report of foreign holders of treasury securities as of March, PolitiFact concluded: ""According to the report, as of February of this year, China held $1.15 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury securities. Together, all foreign holders came to $4.47 trillion. So China's share of that comes to about 26 percent. China, incidentally, tops the list of foreign holders of U.S. debt, followed by Japan and then, with a much smaller share, countries such as the United Kingdom and Brazil. ""But that's just the foreign holders of Treasury securities. More than two-thirds of the debt is held by U.S. residents and institutions. When you look at everyone who holds U.S. Treasury securities, China's share drops to 8.1 percent ($1.15 trillion out of $14 trillion)."" (For the West fact-check, we contacted the U.S. Treasury to ask whether that report had been updated since March and were told that it was the most recent data available.) PolitiFact National continued: ""Of course, there are lots of ways to slice debt statistics. For example, instead of gross federal debt (the figure cited above), some people prefer to use a figure for 'debt held by the public.' That's the gross federal debt minus the share of the debt held by the U.S. government itself. That was $9.4 trillion at the end of 2010. Which would put the portion held by China at about 12.3 percent. There are also Chinese holdings of debt outside of Treasuries, said Derek Scissors of the conservative Heritage Foundation. But that doesn't get Cain anywhere near his 26 percent figure. ""Even stretching, you can't get past 15.6 percent of our debt as held by China and I would not use that number,"" Scissors said. The number cited by Cain is ""misleadingly large,"" Scissors said. ""He's not talking about our debt, he's talking about the foreign share of our debt. If you are going to use that number, you really have to explain it."" We told Sachitano that West's figure was close to China's share of the foreign-held U.S. debt. She replied by e-mail: ""No misrepresentation."" She also referred us to slides on West's website, which he uses at town-hall meetings. On his slide show, however, West's pie charts correctly show China's share of the U.S. debt held by foreigners, a distinction he didn't make on Fox News. The 29 percent figure that West mentioned on Fox is even higher than what Cain had cited, and we've already labeled that too high. The number West used is also wrong. Although on TV he left out only a couple words, those words matter because they make a big difference here. He could have explained that he was referring to foreign holders of U.S. debt -- but he didn't. So his statement makes it appear that China owns a much larger chunk of the federal debt than it does. We rate this claim False."

I just like to make the point that we can argue all day whether this is a moral issue or religious issue or whatever. But the bigger issue here on this political show is that the Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote, 2 percent. Most Muslims, like 77 percent, are Americanized. They've been here for 20 years. Not all Muslims are radical,"" Holder said. It's a little known secret that we're suckers for arguments involving statistics, so we decided to look into Holder's claim that Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote. We began by reading American Muslim Voters and the 2008 Election, a report put out in January 2008 by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a non-profit group that works to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America. The study results come from a random sample telephone survey of 1000 American Muslim registered voters. The group found that 49 percent of Muslim Americans consider themselves Democrats, 36 percent independent, and 8 percent Republicans. The survey, taken before the 2008 election, also asked participants about the presidential candidates. Nearly 45 percent said that they ""don't know"" or ""haven't decided,"" but among those who declared a preference, Democrats took the lead. ""Republican Ron Paul, who is regarded by many Muslims as fair-minded, was mentioned by 2 percent, more than any other Republican hopeful,"" the report stated. Those numbers are consistent with at least one post-election analysis. On November 7, 2008, the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections, an umbrella group for various Muslim advocacy groups, released the results of phone interviews with 637 registered Muslim American voters. The organization found that among those who voted, 88.9 percent backed President Barack Obama; only 2.2 percent voted for Republican John McCain. Then there is the Muslim West Facts Project -- a partnership between Gallup and the Coexist Foundation -- which released Muslim Americans: A National Portrait in early 2009. According to the report, 49 percent of Muslims identified themselves as Democrat; 37 percent said that they were independent and 8 percent considered themselves Republican. Gallup researchers did not analyze what percent of Muslim Americans voted for President Obama, but they found that from January through the end of October 2008, eleven percent said that they would vote for McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin. Eric Nielsen, who heads Gallup media relations, told us during a phone interview that the 11 percent is a ""rough proxy"" of how many Muslim Americans actually voted for the Republican duo. Finally, the Pew Research Center published Muslim Americans in May 2007. The survey found that 11 percent of Muslim Americans identified as Republicans, 63 percent as Democrats, and 26 percent as either independent or having no leaning. During the 2004 presidential election, 14 percent voted for Bush and 71 percent voted for Kerry, according to the study. So, to recap, Holder claimed that Republicans only have 2 percent of the Muslim vote. We found that roughly 8 to 11 percent of Muslims consider themselves Republicans. Muslims voted overwhelmingly for John Kerry during the 2004 election, and at least one post-election analysis shows that McCain only received 2 percent of the vote in the 2008 election. Gallup does not have data on how many Muslims voted for McCain, but we're told that it may be roughly 11 percent, a bit higher than what Holder claimed. Still, that's quite low compared to the support that Democrats have, so Holder's underlying point that Republicans lack significant Muslim backing is valid. We rate this Mostly True."

4059	114	a	Incumbent Republican Senator Rob Portman is continuing to apply pressure to former Democratic Governor Ted Strickland in the Ohio Senate race. In a recent Facebook post on his campaign’s page, Portman made numerous claims pertaining to the effectiveness of Strickland’s political history. “After 12 years in Congress, Ted Strickland was ranked as one of the most absent and ineffective members of Congress and never authored a single bill that became law. Under Governor Ted Strickland, Ohio lost over 350,000 jobs and ranked 48th in job creation,” said Portman. Strickland served as the representative for Ohio’s 6th Congressional District from 1993-94 and 1997-2006. According to GovTrack — a nonpartisan, open data website that tracks the work of the U.S. Congress — from January 1993 to December 2006, Strickland missed 364 out of 6,954 roll-call votes. Strickland missed 5.2 percent of the votes held during his congressional career, noticeably worse than the 2.9 percent lifetime average among all the representatives serving during December 2006.

Scott Walker introduced. The bill, arguably the most controversial of Gov. Walker’s tenure, addressed a projected $3.6 billion budget deficit. Cuts were felt across the the board for public sector employees, affecting collective bargaining rights and a wide range of benefits. Gov.

Jan Brewer catapulted herself into the national spotlight. On April 23, 2010, she signed into law what many call the toughest bill on illegal immigration in the country. The bill makes it a crime to stay in the country illegally, requires all aliens to carry immigration paperwork, and sanctions employers who knowingly hire illegal workers. Facing criticism that the law would legalize racial profiling, the Arizona Legislature modified the law on May 1, 2010. It now states that police officers cannot use race as the sole grounds for suspecting that someone is in the country illegally. The law produced mixed reactions among political leaders. President Barack Obama commented that it threatened ''to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.'' But some people argue that President Obama's reaction is unfounded, given that the majority of Americans actually supports Arizona's immigration law. During his May 27 show, talk host Glenn Beck said that Sixty-four percent of Americans support the Arizona immigration law. Yet we're going to -- we're actually -- our government is going down there to fight them. Eric Holder is fighting them in court. They're becoming more and more brazen each and every day."" Beck is referring to an announcement by Attorney General Eric Holder that the U.S. Department of Justice may challenge the law in court. Given the public outrage over the law, is Beck correct that more than 6 in 10 Americans stand behind Arizona? We decided to find out. The number that Beck cites comes from a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll that was conducted in early May. The poll found that 64 percent of Americans were either somewhat or strongly supportive of the law. There are other polls, however, that show a slightly different result. • An April 27-28 Gallup poll found that of those Americans who have heard of the law, 51 percent support it. Among all Americans, 39 percent favor it, 30 percent oppose it, and 31 percent either had no opinion or have not heard of the law. • A Pew Research Center poll conducted between May 6 and May 9 found that 59 percent approve of the law. • A May 19-24 poll by the Quinnipiac University found 51 percent of American voters support the Arizona law. Moreover, 48 percent say that they want their state to pass an immigration law similar to Arizona's. All of the polls that we've looked at show that more Americans favor the law than oppose it, but the numbers vary widely. To recap. Glenn Beck said on his program that 64 percent of Americans support Arizona's new immigration law. That statistic, however, comes from a single poll. Other polls show slightly lower approval ratings. Still, his underlying point that most Americans agree with Arizona is correct. We rate this one Mostly True."

pomt-13481	Says Ron Johnson gave himself a $10 million 'sweetheart corporate payout'	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/09/russ-feingold/did-ron-johnson-approve-10m-bonus-himself/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has touted his private-sector experience in his 2016 re-election bid, just as he did in 2010. But it’s a big final payday his opponent wants you to remember. Russ Feingold invoked the matter in a campaign ad in June. Then again in early July. And again in late July. The central claim in all three is that Johnson gave himself a $10 million payout when he left his Oshkosh manufacturing firm after winning the 2010 election. The ads imply there’s something shady about the payment, particularly one launched June 14, 2016. Black and white images of Johnson, the U.S. Capitol and cash fill the screen as a narrator ominously states: Before Sen. Johnson left for Washington, he gave himself $10 million, a sweetheart corporate payout."" Was such a payment made, and, if so, is there anything questionable about it? Let’s dig in. Johnson’s $10 million At issue is money Johnson received shortly before taking office in 2011. It came to light in a federal Financial Disclosure Report that listed the payment as compensation from Pacur, the company he helped found and bought in 1997. Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice in 2011 the payment was back pay for serving as CEO the previous 13 years, as he had not taken a paycheck since purchasing the company. Johnson sold most of the company in 2010 and stopped active involvement in its operations, though he retains a 5 percent stake, according to campaign spokesman William Allison. Johnson hasn’t gone into much detail on the nature of the payout, saying at the time, ""It's a private business. I've complied with all the disclosure laws, and I don't have to explain it any further to someone like you."" The column noted the pay didn’t appear to be part of a pre-determined compensation package. Johnson described the payment in 2011 as an ""agreed-upon amount,"" then acknowledged the person who agreed to it was the owner — himself. Allison said Pacur followed ""followed standard business practices to settle the account and independently calculate the back pay (Johnson) was owed as a result."" He said the payout was reviewed as part of a routine IRS audit and the IRS ""took no issue with it."" Allison declined to elaborate on the process by which the $10 million amount was decided and approved. So Johnson received $10 million. Does that make it a ""sweetheart corporate payout"" as the ad claims? That’s a pretty subjective description, but it implies there was something special or unusual about the amount. When considered as back pay, the $10 million works out to about $770,000 per year. That would be a ""fairly typical"" compensation package for an owner and CEO of a company the size of Pacur, according to a blog post last year in Plastics News. The trade publication does an annual executive pay study for the plastics industry, though it noted it had to estimate the size of Pacur since the private company does not release sales information. David Walker, a professor and executive compensation expert at Boston University School of Law, said that annual amount ""doesn’t seem implausible,"" for someone in Johnson’s position, since many owners of small businesses take out most of the profits as compensation. But like other experts contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Walker said it’s hard to put the amount in context since Pacur is a private company, so we don’t know key factors like its size, profits and other executive compensation. The timing of Johnson’s payment is also noteworthy, though it’s not directly addressed in any of Feingold’s ads. The original column points out the $10 million payment came on the heels of a campaign where Johnson spent $9 million of his own money. Critics said the payout looked like an attempt to circumvent federal regulations and have the company pay for Johnson’s campaign. Corporations are not allowed to contribute directly to federal or state campaigns, and they can’t give money to a candidate for the express purpose of reimbursing campaign costs. The Federal Election Commission never issued a public finding regarding the payment to Johnson. A group claimed to have submitted a complaint last year, but an FEC spokeswoman said it the agency never received it. Election lawyers told Bice in 2011 that Johnson likely didn’t violate any election laws, and proving otherwise would have required a written agreement or other direct proof of a prior plan to reimburse campaign expenses. Such proof never surfaced. Our rating In a recent TV ad, Feingold claims Johnson gave himself $10 million in a ""sweetheart corporate payout."" The amount is accurate, and Johnson did essentially give it to himself since he acknowledged he was the one to approve it. But there’s no evidence to show this payment was unusual or out of line, as the tone and use of the ""sweetheart"" descriptor imply. An industry trade publication said the amount is reasonable given Johnson’s role and longevity. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/00cdbff3-5150-48b7-bcf4-12e5fdd5fc83"

He signed an executive order instructing budget writers to root out waste in the federal government. And his proposed budget included cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as education programs. Trump’s moves have sparked outcry among Democrats, who have argued that the cuts will make government less effective and endanger the environment. In North Carolina, state Rep. Bobbie Richardson recently took to Twitter to raise alarm about Trump’s latest budget proposal and how it affects the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Richardson, a three-term representative from Louisburg, is the Democratic whip in the state House. The president is cutting the CDC budget by 80%. Is this recklessness or deliberate action against preventive healthcare?"" Richardson tweeted on Feb. 3. She has about 1,000 followers. PolitiFact found this tweet questionable. The CDC is the nation’s primary source for developing and applying disease prevention methods and health education activities. Cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent would have a drastic impact on its ability to study America’s ability to help prevent illness across the country. What the CDC said Finding the truth seemed as simple as asking CDC officials about their budget. So we reached out to them. Bernadette Burden, a senior press officer for the CDC, responded Wednesday. She said the CDC’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019, which starts in July, is $5.66 billion. That’s a decrease of approximately $1.4 billion – or 20 percent – compared to the spending level, Burden said in an email. A breakdown of spending in the current fiscal year is available on the CDC website. The CDC provided a fact sheet of Trump’s budget, which outlines where he aims to cut. Among other changes, Trump’s budget would cut $138 million from the program dedicated to chronic disease prevention and health promotion, cut $59.9 million from programs studying ""emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases,"" and $46 million from a program called ""Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health."" A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be transmitted from animals to people. Burden noted that the CDC adapted its budget request to includes program reductions and eliminations that Trump proposed last year. Misreading headlines? PolitiFact couldn’t find any news articles that verified Richardson’s claim. It’s possible that Richardson misquoted the headline from this Washington Post story: ""CDC to cut by 80 percent efforts to prevent global disease outbreak."" The story says the CDC is downsizing one of its specific efforts – its epidemic prevention activities – because money is running out. The epidemic prevention programs ""train front-line workers in outbreak detection and work to strengthen laboratory and emergency response systems in countries where disease risks are greatest,"" the Post reported. The CDC is cutting its efforts in 39 out of 49 countries. It’s unclear if Richardson misread the Washington Post headline. Nonetheless, PolitiFact believes this opportunity is as good as any to remind folks to read stories before making judgements about news based on headlines. As for Richardson, her assistant, Anna Meadows, confirmed that neither she nor Richardson could find the original source for the tweet. ""She deleted the post after your inquiry, since she couldn’t find the source,"" Meadows said in an email. Our ruling Richardson tweeted that President Trump is ""cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent."" The proposal is a 20 percent cut – which is not remotely close to Richardson’s claim. She deleted the tweet. So we rate this claim False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com"

obry-00036	During a Sept. 22 speech at Ripon College, Waupaca Mayor Brian Smith expressed his disapproval of extending the UW System’s in-state tuition freeze through a fifth year, citing the decision makers’ lack of a plan for dealing with the losses suffered from the freeze. On Oct. 7, the Board of Regents voted unanimously in favor of a resolution to the state budget that would freeze tuition through the 2017-18 academic year, but then raise tuition by a small increment for 2018-19. Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the state legislature will ultimately decide whether or not to include the resolution in the final 2017-19 budget. Asked if he would advise against the freeze, Smith, who was unsuccessful in his challenge of Republican incumbent Luther Olsen for the 14th District in the state Senate, made the following claim: “If you’re going to freeze tuition, then you have to find another way to fund education at the university level. And they (Walker and the Republican party) haven’t come up with a plan. Except, the plan is to have massive layoffs –– of not only professors, but also to have layoffs of their assistants –– and increase class sizes.” 	mostly_false	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/12/06/does-walker-have-a-plan-to-fund-uws-fifth-year-of-frozen-tuition/	None	None	None	Evan Winter	None	Does Walker have a plan to fund UW’s fifth year of frozen tuition?

8319	9	a	"Hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries and so forth are more extensively used and far more expensive in this country than they are in many other countries.''	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/22/mitt-romney/romney-overstates-united-states-medical-costs-and-/	While promoting his new book in an appearance on Fox News Sunday on March 7, 2010, Mitt Romney offered an interesting explanation of why health care costs so much in the United States. He said there are undoubtably some bad health insurance companies among the many in the United States, and they should be held accountable, but the industry is not the cause of increasing health care costs. The president is scapegoating. It's something which he is fond to do any time one of his programs gets in trouble. He decides to pick a target and say, 'This is the cause of America's problem,' whether that's Wall Street, or Goldman Sachs, or bankers, or wealthy people, or whether it's insurance companies,'' Romney said. ""To suggest that the overall health care cost of America, which, by the way, is dramatically higher than any other nation in the world, is because of the insurance companies is obviously quite silly. ""Our health care costs are very, very high because we use a lot of health treatments. Hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries and so forth are more extensively used and far more expensive in this country than they are in many other countries. It's not the insurance companies that are driving our health care cost up and up. The reason their premiums are going up is because doctor bills and hospital bills and usage and so forth is also going up.'' That's a lot to check -- hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries --but we were game. We found that while Romney is correct in parts of the claim, he's wrong in others. Although ""many countries"" can be interpreted a lot of different ways, for the purposes of our analysis, we think it's fair to compare the United States with other economically developed countries in the world. Fortunately for our fact-checking, there's a group that compiles this data: the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, or OECD. They gather data from around the world on health, medicine, economics and other social indicators, and their statistics are widely respected. Let's start with hospitals. According to OECD data, Romney is correct about U.S. hospitals costing more, but wrong about them being more extensively used. As a percentage of the population, fewer Americans are admitted to hospitals, and spend less time in hospitals than the average country. The United States also has fewer hospital beds, with 3.1 beds per 1,000 people versus the OECD average of 5.7. The length of stay in a hospital for acute care is a full day less than in the average OECD country (5.5 versus 6.5 days), and the United States has 126.3 hospital discharges per 1,000 people versus the average 157.8. Discharges are used to measure the amount of visits to the hospital. Moving on to doctors, Romney is right again about what doctors are paid -- more in the United States -- but wrong that they're used more extensively. U.S. doctors are paid significantly more than the average doctor in other countries. The ""price"" includes fees and activities, so one reason U.S. doctors may be paid more is because they see more patients, but the OECD suspects that American doctors are largely paid more because their fees are higher. Doctors in the United States are paid $25,000 to $40,000 more than those in Britain, Germany and Canada. However, there are fewer practicing physicians in the United States than the average, and American patients have doctor consultations much less often than citizens do in other countries monitored by the OECD. In the United States there are 3.8 doctor consultations per person annually, which is almost half of the 6.8 average of countries monitored by the OECD. A consultation includes general practitioners and specialists, and includes almost any type of environment in which you would consult a doctor. The only caveat is that this does not include people like registered nurse practitioners, who are allowed to prescribe medicine to patients but are not doctors. Romney is unquestionably correct when it comes to MRIs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides doctors with a detailed image of, for instance, cardiovascular damage. The United States gives the most MRI exams of all the countries monitored by the OECD, with more than twice the average amount of exams given per year and twice the average amount of MRI machines as a percentage of the population. The International Federation of Health Plans, a group of private insurers in different countries, reports that the United States has significantly higher fees than Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, France and Britain. The average fee for an MRI exam in the United States is $1,200. It is $179 in Britain, $235 in Spain, $567 in the Netherlands and $839 in Germany. Regarding surgery, the United States appears to have an above-average amount of in-patient surgeries and ambulatory surgeries. Ambulatory surgery is a component of what is considered a day surgery -- an operation in which the patient leaves the clinic or hospital the same day. The United States has 92.8 in-patient surgeries per 1,000 people annually versus the average of 68.3. According to the OECD, ambulatory surgeries are especially disproportionate, with the United States having a rate three times greater than the average country. The OECD does not have data on the amount of total surgeries in the United States, but all the available data suggest that it has a higher rate of surgeries than the average of the countries the group monitors. It's fairly well established that the United States spends more on health care than other economically developed countries, so high costs do not come as a surprise. Romney was right about MRIs, surgery, hospitals and doctors all costing more in the United States. Regarding quantity, he was also right about higher rates of MRI exams and surgery here, but wrong about hospital usage and doctor consultations. We're rating this Mostly True."

The hybrid plan that Governor Lincoln Chafee and General Treasurer Gina Raimondo have been touting would combine a smaller guaranteed monthly payout from a traditional pension with a variable payout based on the investment earnings of a 401(k)-style plan. While pitching their pension overhaul legislation to a joint meeting of the Senate and House Finance Committees Oct. 24, Chafee, an Independent, spoke at length about how the plan would address the state’s $9.4-billion pension shortfall. And also,’’ the governor said, ""somebody told me recently that if Rhode Island does a hybrid plan we’ll be the first state in the nation to do this.’’ The first in the nation? Chafee continued: ""And I think that’s in all of our interest to show the rest of the country that we can take on this challenge and share the ups and downs of the market with the employer and the employee. Right now, we the state, the employer, takes all the hit when the market goes down. And so I think the country will be looking at us . . . "" Rhode Island, of course, isn’t the only state to wrestle with pension problems. So we wondered: Would Rhode Island be the first in the nation to adopt a hybrid retirement plan? The facts A quick search of the Wall Street Journal’s archives turned up a story from July 10, 2010, entitled ""States Shift to Hybrid Pensions.’’ The article begins: ""State governments, one of the last bastions of guaranteed pensions, are increasingly taking a page from 401(k) plans that dominate the private sector.’’ Utah, Michigan, Oregon and Washington, the article states, all have some form of hybrid plan. Next, we called The National Association of State Retirement Administrators, a nonprofit membership organization whose members are directors of the nation’s public retirement systems. Keith Brainard, the association’s research director, provided us with a table that shows that seven states have some form of hybrid plan for public employees. They are: Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Utah. (Michigan offers the hybrid plan only to school employees.) Their plans, like the one the Chafee administration has proposed for Rhode Island, share two features: a traditional pension with a guaranteed benefit, coupled with a 401(k)-style component that offers a payout tied to investment earnings. We called the governor’s office, and his spokeswoman, Christine Hunsinger, quickly responded that the governor had ""made a mistake."" Rhode Island, she conceded, would not be the first state to adopt a hybrid plan. OK, so the governor was wrong. Rhode Island didn’t come up with the idea first. But we still wondered what was happening elsewhere in the country. We contacted retirement administrators in other states to find out. At least two states -- Washington and Indiana -- have had hybrid retirement plans since the 1990s. During the 1990s stock-market boom, a legislative pension committee in Washington saw an opportunity to ""self-fund"" a portion of its retirement plan, said Dave Nelsen, legal and legislative services manager for the Washington State Department of Retirement Systems. The teachers union was the first to endorse the idea, he recalled, and in 1995, a bill ""sailed through the legislature"" to allow teachers to supplement their traditional pensions with something similar to a 401(k) plan. In 2002, the State of Washington passed its own bill to create a hybrid option for all new public employees. Indiana enacted legislation in 1998 to allow public employees to invest some of their retirement money in selected bonds and money market funds. (The hybrid plan proposed by the Chafee administration is similar to Indiana’s, said Brainard, of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.) Ohio offered a hybrid plan to new state employees and those with less than five years of service in 2003. Oregon followed in 2004; Georgia in 2009; and Michigan (for school employees only) in 2010. Utah last year replaced its traditional defined benefit pensions with 401(k)-style plans for new state and municipal workers. The Chafee administration’s proposal could, however, set Rhode Island apart from other states in one respect, Brainard said: it would require not just new hires but also most existing employees (except judges, state police, correctional officers and municipal police and firefighters) to participate in the hybrid plan. In fact, Hunsinger told PolitiFact that was actually what the governor had been told would make Rhode Island ""the first in the nation."" But we’d caution the governor on that statement, too. We found that at least one other state -- Kansas -- has proposed doing the same. The ruling Governor Chafee was clearly wrong when he told state lawmakers that if they approve his administration’s pension reforms, Rhode Island would ""be the first state in the nation’’ to adopt a hybrid plan. These types of plans have been widely publicized in the national media and on the National Association of State Retirement Administrator’s web site, and our research found at least seven other states offer hybrid pension plans, some dating back to the 1990s. We rule his statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)"

10050	12	a	A key piece of the budget proposal from Republicans in the Minnesota House is a bill to fund health and human services. It cuts more than $1 billion in spending, effectively allowing the GOP to cut taxes by $2 billion. The proposal has been controversial among Democrats, in part because $500 million of the savings come from ending MinnesotaCare, a health insurance program for the working poor. Democrats are also pointing to another cut in the bill that they contend amounts to a budget gimmick. They say the plan’s projected $300 million in savings from eliminating waste and fraud from Medicaid and other public programs would actually yield much less – around $16.5 million –which they say would leave a $283 million hole in the GOP budget for the coming biennium.

Mike Pence off the back of a treadmill. It came during a back-and-forth on the Morning Joe program on MSNBC on March 24, 2010, between host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., over the tax effects of the health care reform bill. Let's listen in: If this fall's election is going to be a referendum on this health care bill,"" Scarborough said, ""What should Democrats do when their opponents say, correctly, this is the largest tax increase in U.S. history? And it was passed at a time when we've got 17 percent real unemployment. And also, it's a further expansion of the federal government at a time when that worries a lot of Americans."" ""Joe, I keep hearing you every morning talking about the biggest tax increase in history, but you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history,"" Durbin responded ""We have almost $500 billion in tax cuts. And the tax cuts go to small businesses to help pay for health insurance premiums. They're going to go to individuals who can't afford their health insurance premiums. It's really going to make certain everybody has a chance for affordable health insurance."" Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, later told Scarborough he was watching the exchange live while working out on a treadmill and that when Durbin said the health care bill is also the biggest tax cut in history, ""I almost tripped and flew off the back of the thing."" We took a two-pronged approach to this exchange, and in a separate item, we examined Scarborough's claim that the bill is ""the largest tax increase in U.S. history."" In this one, we'll tackle Durbin's claim that the bill is ""also the biggest tax cut in history."" Is it really treadmill-launching wrong? During the interview, an incredulous Scarborough asked Durbin his source for that claim. ""Well, the source is the bill,"" Durbin said. ""And I've read it."" The bill may explain provisions, but Durbin gets his numbers that the bill includes $500 billion in tax cuts from a report by the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bulk of that, $464 billion over 10 years, comes from tax credits to subsidize the cost insurance for lower-income people not insured through their employer. In addition, the March 20, 2010, report from the CBO estimates that small companies will get $40 billion worth of tax relief over the next 10 years to help offset the cost of providing health insurance for their employees. Specifically, from 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the insurance exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost. Those small business tax credits are no-doubt-about-it tax cuts. But many Republicans and tax experts contend the subsidies provided to lower-income Americans to help pay for health insurance, even though they come through tax credits, hardly qualify as tax cuts. Here's why: Americans who make a decent living but qualify for some government help on health insurance premiums may have such a large tax burden that the tax credits really are a reduction in taxes, said William Ahern with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. But for many -- if not most -- of those getting the tax credits, the subsidies are more than the person would otherwise owe in income taxes. For those people, he said, the tax credits are ""just a check from the government,"" Ahern said. ""There has been a running debate over whether such checks should be called tax cuts,"" Ahern said. Ahern is of the school that thinks when the government is writing checks, that shouldn't be called a tax cut. A news release from the Republicans in Congress also correctly notes that the provision is a direct payment to insurance companies, not to the taxpayer. ""It would not reduce any individual's tax liability,"" the release states, ""and is therefore not a tax cut."" ""You can quibble over what to call it,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, but when you have subsidies tied to tax credits, as they are, they need to be reconciled with one's taxable income, and so a credible case can be made that they are tax cuts. We're not going to weigh into this philosophical debate on taxes, because there are other more clear-cut reasons why Durbin's claim is misleading. For one, it fails to mention that even if you regard the insurance subsidies for people in the exchange as tax cuts, there are also significant tax increases. Here are the biggies, along with what the government's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates they will bring in over the next 10 years: • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans,"" over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, new annual fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2014, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. The 10-year total: $20 billion. Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. In all, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates various revenue-generating provisions in the health bill will bring $437 billion over the next 10 years. ""There are big chunks of money coming in and big chunks of money going out,"" Blumberg said. ""We need to get away from the extremes in this conversation. There are big revenues being raised and big spending."" So let's talk net. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the changes in direct spending and revenue effects of the health care reform bill (as well as the reconciliation bill, which has yet to pass) and concluded the total net effect is that the bill would bring in an additional $525 billion in total revenues over the next 10 years. In recent weeks, President Barack Obama has repeatedly used a variation of Durbin's claim. For example, in remarks on health care reform in Iowa on March 25, 2010, Obama said, ""And when this exchange is up and running, millions of people will get tax breaks to help them afford coverage – credits that add up to the largest middle class tax cut for health care in history."" There are a couple qualifiers in there that Durbin failed to mention. For one, Obama referred to middle class tax cut. That conveniently ignores the significant tax increases that predominantly will hit higher income people, the Medicare payroll tax and those with ""Cadillac health plans."" Obama also limits his claim to tax cuts for health care. It in no way is the largest tax cut of any kind. The Bush tax cuts alone dwarf these cuts. ""It's wrong in both directions,"" Ahern said of claims that the health care bill is either the largest tax cut or tax increase in history. ""It's obviously not the largest tax cut."" To sum up, when Durbin said the bill is ""also the biggest tax cut in history,"" it's based first on the contentious assumption that tax credits to help lower income people buy insurance on the exchange can be called tax cuts. But more than that, if you look at the net effect, the bill is a tax increase. In general, higher income people will pay more, lower income people will get more. In any case, even if you only looked at that side of the ledger, the side with $500 billion of tax credits over 10 years, that wouldn't be the largest tax cut in history. Durbin would have been closer to the truth had he stuck to the president's script -- largest middle class tax cut for health care -- but we think even that is misleading because it ignores that the bill is an overall tax-raiser. But as Durbin even left those qualifiers out of his statement, that makes our call easy: It's False."

13265	9	a	"The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country.''	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/22/barack-obama/obama-campaign-financed-large-donors-too/	New financial regulations are pending in Congress, but both political parties get a lot of campaign contributions from the people they intend to regulate -- Wall Street. The financial sector donates millions to both Republican and Democratic candidates. And during the last couple of election cycles, Democrats have outstripped Republicans, who have traditionally been thought of as more business-friendly. Those political realities have made for interesting dynamics as the negotiations on financial regulation continue. President Barack Obama answered questions on this topic in an interview with CNBC's John Harwood on April 21, 2010. In the 2008 campaign, you got a lot of money, about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs,"" Harwood said. ""Your former White House counsel Greg Craig is apparently going to represent Goldman Sachs. In light of this case, do either of those things embarrass you?"" ""No,"" Obama said. ""First of all, I got a lot of money from a lot of people. And the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country. And moreover, anybody who gave me money during the course of my campaign knew that I was on record again in 2007, and 2008, pushing very strongly that we needed to reform how Wall Street did business. And so, nobody should be surprised in the position that I'm taking now because it is one that I was very clear about in the course of the campaign."" What jumped out at us in this exchange was Obama's statement, ""the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country."" We've seen that statement repeated elsewhere, but the evidence doesn't back it up. Campaign contributions are public record, so there's verifiable data on how much political candidates receive and who gives it to them. Obama did raise a lot of money from small donations collected over the Internet, and several groups have analyzed the information to determine how much that was. While Obama got more money from small donors than his opponents, they did not account for the majority of his funds. We're setting the bar for a small donor as someone who gives $200 or less. The Federal Election Commission rules say that someone who gives this amount does not need to publicly disclose their name, address, occupation and employer. In the general election, Obama got about 34 percent of his individual donations from small donors, people who gave $200 or less, according to a report from the Campaign Finance Institute. Another 23 percent of donations came from people who gave between $201 and $999, and another 42 percent from people who gave $1,000 or more. His numbers for the primary were similar. He got about 30 percent of his money from donors who gave $200 or less. Another 28 percent of donations came from people who gave between $201 and $999, and 43 percent from people who gave $1,000 or more. These numbers were compiled by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, and included in a report Reform in an Age of Networked Campaigns, which was published jointly with the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute. During the campaign, Obama ended up opting out of the public financing system for presidential candidates, because the system limits how much money candidates can raise, and Obama realized he could raise much more money outside of the system. (Read more details from our previous report, 'Parallel public financing'? Only partly.) Obama was bothered about opting out of the public financing system, because he believed it would undercut his moral authority in arguing for campaign finance reform, according to Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, who wrote about the decision in his campaign memoir, The Audacity to Win. So the campaign considered opting out of the federal system but limiting contributions to $250. ""The idea sounded appealing,"" Plouffe writes. ""But when our finance staff ran the numbers, it became clear this option would produce the worst of both worlds: we would not raise enough money to justify the pummeling we would take."" Obama supporters like to counter that Obama raised more money from small donors than any previous candidate for president, which is true. But Obama still needed large donors to fund his campaign. Obama implies that he won the presidency without much money from large donors, and the evidence does not support that. In fact, even if we set the bar for small donors higher -- if we stipulated that everyone who gave less than $1,000 was a small donor -- that still means 43 percent gave more. And the interviewer, John Harwood, was correct when he said Obama got about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs; the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics puts the number at $994,795. Obama's skill at raising money from small donors for the 2008 campaign was significant. But Obama was also skilled at raising money from large donors. His statement was, ""the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country."" That's not the case. Only 32 percent of his general election money came from people who gave $200 or less. We rate his statement False."

13492	9	a	"No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008, especially in the general.’’	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-no-candidate-has-run-more-negative-ads/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spoke to CNN on the state's primary day and predicted that the winner of Florida -- which turned out to be Mitt Romney -- would likely be the nominee of the Republican Party. On CNN, Rubio was asked about the many negative ads that ran during the campaign and if it was a preview of what was to come in the general election. I think that's been a part of every campaign,"" Rubio said. ""Unfortunately, it's only gotten worse. No candidate in American history has ever run more negative ads than Barack Obama. I don't think that will change in 2012. Unfortunately people have to get used to it. I think voters see through that."" Did Obama earn the mantle of running the most negative ads in American history? Detailed data on campaign advertising has been kept since the 1996 founding of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which is part of Kantar Media, said Erika Franklin Fowler, assistant professor of government at Wesleyan University and co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. The predecessor to the Wesleyan Media Project, the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, did an analysis of that data for the 2008 campaign. The 2008 presidential campaign set a record for political ads; television ads totaled nearly $600 million. Combined, the candidates aired more than 1.1 million campaign ads. Obama aired 141,541 spots and spent more than $74 million on television ads during the Democratic primary. During the Republican primary, McCain aired 19,581 ads at the cost of approximately $12 million. These are figures for candidates’ spending -- not that of other groups. Between June and election day, Obama far outspent McCain: Obama spent more than $226 million to McCain’s expenditure of over $162 million. Obama aired more than 436,000 ads, while McCain aired 337,000 ads. The report concluded that Obama bought significantly more ads, but that more of McCain's ads were negative. ""During the final presidential debate Sen. John McCain argued that Obama had ‘spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history,’ while Barack Obama accused Sen. McCain of running an entirely negative campaign,"" the report said. ""In a way, both candidates were correct. .... At certain points in the campaign Barack Obama aired nearly as many negative or contrast ads as John McCain aired altogether. As a proportion, however, it is clear that most of McCain’s ads were negative in tone."" The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker examined the same claim and cited a study by University of Missouri professor William Benoit who is now a professor at Ohio University. We also spoke to Benoit. ""It is true (Obama) ran more negative ads or ran them more often than McCain, but if you look at the content of the ads to see what they were saying, it was really about the same,’’ in terms of what percentage were negative, Benoit said. Benoit said he examined specific negative and positive statements in TV ads by the campaigns. One ad could have both negative and positive statements. During the primary election, 19 percent of the statements he examined in McCain ads were negative, while for Obama 20 percent of statements were negative. During the general election, Benoit found that 68 percent of the statements in Obama’s ads were attacks while McCain’s were 62 percent attacks. (Benoit did a separate analysis of Obama’s 30-minute ad near the end of the campaign and found that only 18 percent of the statements were attacks as Obama tried to end on a mostly positive note.) Benoit said that the difference in the general election in terms of percentages wasn’t significant, concluding that about two-thirds of both campaigns' statements in the general election were attacks. Benoit said he has analyzed TV ads back to 1952, and the only campaign that came close to that was Dwight Eisenhower’s 1952 campaign -- 69 percent of his statements were negative. ""Obama and a Republican -- Eisenhower -- are about virtually tied,"" Benoit said. ""Eisenhower had one percentage point more."" Benoit told us that Obama ran more negative ads because he ran many more ads overall, both positive and negative. ""He ran more simply because he had more money not because of the tone of the ads he had were more negative. There was no significant difference in the tone of ads both campaigns created,"" he said. Rubio responds Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told us in an e-mail: ""(Obama) spent way more on TV ads than any other campaign in history, and they were predominately negative."" Conant also sent a few articles that appeared during the campaign about Obama’s rampant spending including Washington Post article that stated that Obama and Democratic Party committees spent nearly $105 million the first two weeks of October compared to just over $25 million by McCain and Republican entities. Our Ruling Rubio said. ""No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008, especially in the general.’’ In sheer numbers, that statement is correct: Obama bought many more ads than McCain did, both positive and negative. Nevertheless, two studies suggest that, overall, Obama's ads were not significantly more negative than his rival. He ran the most negative ads because he ran the most ads. We rate Rubio's statement Mostly True."

Late in the debate, House Minority Leader Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, quizzed a number of Republican representatives on their views on climate change. Among them was Rep. Glen Gruenhagen, R-Glencoe, who has said in the past that he’s skeptical climate change is real. Thissen asked him if he thinks climate change is caused by human activity. “I believe there are eminently qualified scientists who would disagree [that climate change is caused by human activity], and I agree with those scientists,” Gruenhagen said. Gruenhagen has a right to his opinion, but his comments – and comments made by other Legislators during the debate – suggest the scientific community is divided on the topic.

14511	12	a	The 2015 session will be remembered as the one when Gov. Mark Dayton and the Legislature couldn’t come to terms on education funding. Dayton vetoed the education bill. Dayton wants $150 million more in the K-12 education bill to support pre-kindergarten programs in public schools. Republicans and some DFLers say the additional $400 million they put into education should be enough. Most of it is going to the per pupil formula. It’s an issue that has pitted Dayton against members of his own party, and underscores a fundamental difference in how many Democrats and Republicans view the issue of early learning. Many on the right say that, in addition to giving schools more money across the board, extra cash should be invested in early learning scholarships for low-income students, which gives parents a choice in where their kids start their education. (The funding bill includes money for this program, too.) On the left, many believe that to level the playing field for all kids, early education should be free and offered universally in public schools. This week, PoliGraph looked at two essential arguments on either side of the debate. The impasse sets the Legislature up for a special session to renegotiate a deal before July 1, when the new fiscal year begins and the state’s education department would shut down without annual funding. Republicans say Minnesota’s school administrators oppose Dayton’s pre-K plan. Dayton’s proposed expansion would be voluntary and for only half the day. Some school superintendents do oppose the idea. For instance, the Association of Metropolitan School Districts, which represents schools in the Twin Cities area, said universal pre-kindergarten “is a worthy goal.” “But our school districts need time to secure the necessary classroom space and licensed staff, develop transportation plans, provide staff training, and be prepared to serve pre-kindergarten students with special needs,” wrote AMSD executive director Scott Croonquist in a letter to House Education Finance Chair Rep. Jenifer Loon, R-Eden Prairie earlier this month. Instead, Croonquist’s group supports more funding for the per pupil formula – which is what the bill sent to Dayton includes – and higher investments in the School Readiness program, which serves 3 and 4 year olds who are underprepared for kindergarten. Similar views are shared by the Minnesota School Boards Association, individual administrators across the state, and even Dayton’s Early Learning Council, which suggested some of the money should be invested in the early education scholarship program. The Minnesota Association of School Administrators has a more nuanced view on the issue. Executive Director Gary Amoroso said his group supports Dayton’s call for $150 million more. But it would like to see much of it added to the formula, with an undefined expansion of early childhood learning coming next. Amoroso said he doesn’t view the issue as a divide between Dayton and the superintendents. However, some superintendents do support Dayton’s proposal. They include Julia Espe, who is superintendent of Princeton’s Public Schools. She wrote in a letter to legislators that “universal pre-K for 4-year-olds will help us with our core mission–educating every single student… Why can’t we provide this strategy to close the achievement gap when the state has a surplus?” Espe’s views were echoed by superintendents in Bloomington, Maplewood and South St. Paul, among other places. Dayton says universal pre-kindergarten in public schools will help close the achievement gap. At the core of Dayton’s argument is that expanding pre-kindergarten to public schools will give all kids a better start in life. Dayton has cause for concern. Minnesota ranks last among 41 states when it comes to access to state pre-kindergarten programs and Minnesota ranks high when it comes to daycare and pre-kindergarten costs. And the state’s achievement gap between white students and students of color remains stubbornly wide. Meanwhile, there’s some consensus among early learning experts that students, regardless of race and economic background, who attend high quality pre-kindergarten do better in school and in life, said Milagros Nores, who is Associate Director of Research at the National Institute for Early Education Research. Nores added that the effects are even stronger for low-income, minority and dual language children. But Nores said learning can happen in a number of settings, not just public schools, and still be successful. “If the experience is high-quality, then it doesn’t matter where the child learns,” she said. Some states, including Georgia, have an all-public approach, and the outcomes are good. Other states use a combination of public and private programs, and children are successful there, too, Nores said. Minnesota falls into the latter category, with lower-income children accessing pre-K with state-funded scholarships. Dayton’s budget preserves that funding, but critics say more money should be dedicated to those programs. University of Minnesota professor and early childhood learning expert Arthur Reynolds agrees that quality trumps location. But Reynolds also pointed out that many of the factors associated with quality – such as teaching skills and curriculum – are often found in the public school setting. “Many of these features are more common in schools, especially teacher pay and certification, but private centers can also be very strong in these areas, sometimes stronger such as in [lower] group size,” Reynolds said. “There tends to be more variation in quality in private programs comparatively.” Reynolds also emphasized access, particularly when it comes to pre-K costs in Minnesota. “There has been greater reliance on private programs, family -based programs but the need to build a larger more unified system is real and that is what the Governor is proposing,” Reynold said. The Verdicts Figuring out how to better educate Minnesota’s children is a politically thorny and complicated issue. And while there’s some uncertainty about how widespread support is for Dayton’s plan and whether ultimately expanding pre-kindergarten to all public schools is entirely necessary, politicians on both sides of the issue are making sound and reasonable arguments based on plenty of facts.

Harris, who currently serves as Winnebago County Executive, spoke about a variety of topics ranging from education funding to gas taxes and differences from his opponent. Our focus is on Harris’ proposal for how to raise the minimum wage. Instead of giving one specific amount that he thinks should be the minimum wage, Harris said that raising the minimum wage too much could be unsustainable for certain businesses and may lead to unemployment. Harris proposed “something more like 50 percent or 60 percent of the prior year’s average wage…it would come out closer to nine dollars, that might be a more realistic first step.” The Observatory checked if 50 or 60 percent of the previous year’s average hourly wage is actually nine dollars. Harris suggested updating the wage periodically and that the wage is indexed so “that people don’t wallow at that wage for years and years before it’s updated again.”

Today, a full Pell Grant covers just 34 percent of those costs.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/22/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-says-full-pell-grants-cover-only-34/	On July 28, 2011, The Hill newspaper ran a story saying, House conservatives who have stalled legislation to raise the national debt limit are angry that it includes $17 billion in supplemental spending for Pell Grants, which some compare to welfare."" Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse cited that article when he rose to speak on the Senate floor the following day. He criticized House Republicans for an earlier failed attempt to cut Pell Grant funding, and he defended the debt deal’s increase in Pell Grant funding, noting the program’s Rhode Island roots. ""When Rhode Island’s great Senator Claiborne Pell first proposed the grants that now bear his name, he envisioned a grant that would enable low-income students to attend our country’s wonderful colleges and universities so they, too, could share in the American dream,"" Whitehouse said. ""In 1976, the first year that Pell Grants were fully funded, a full Pell Grant paid 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. Today, a full Pell Grant covers just 34 percent of those costs. Still, this vital assistance can often mean the difference between being able to attend college or not. With many families in Rhode Island and the country still struggling in this economy, we should be looking for ways to strengthen Pell Grants, not weaken them."" Whether Pell grants should be cut or increased is for others to decide. But we wondered whether their buying power has really plunged as far as Whitehouse claimed. We asked Whitehouse’s office to provide the basis for his assertion. The senator’s spokesman provided a document, dated July 12, from the Federal Education Budget Project of the New America Foundation, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. ""In fiscal year 1976, the first year that the Pell Grant program was fully funded at its authorized level, the maximum Pell Grant was $1,400 and covered 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college,"" the document said. ""Despite regular increases in funding and grant levels, the purchasing power of the Pell Grant has decreased over the past 30 years as the price of college has risen. In the 2009-10 school year, the maximum Pell Grant covered 36 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college."" To check the think tank’s numbers, we turned to the U.S. Department of Education, which administers the Pell Grant program. It said the maximum grant was $5,350 in 2009-10 -- up from $1,400 in 1976-77. The department’s National Center for Education Statistics said the average cost of attending a four-year public institution was $15,014 in 2009-10 -- up from $1,935 in 1976-77. Do the math and you find the maximum Pell Grant covered 36 percent of the average cost of attending a four-year public institution in 2009-10 --- down from 72 percent in 1976-77. That’s exactly what the New America Foundation document said, but it’s not exactly what Whitehouse said on the Senate floor: that Pell grants ""now"" cover 34 percent of those costs. So why the slight discrepancy? Whitehouse’s spokesman said the senator was referring to more recent figures, for the 2010-11 academic year. He cited a report from the Advocacy & Policy Center of College Board, a nonprofit membership organization that sells standardized tests and does education research. That report notes that the maximum Pell Grant has risen to $5,550 for the 2010-11 academic year. ""This amount covers 34 percent of the average published tuition, fees, room, and board at a public four-year college,"" the report says, using an average cost of $16,140 for attending a four-year public institution in 2010-11. Whitehouse appears to have done his homework. We rate this claim True."

Even Democrats in the Minnesota Senate, who are up for re-election in 2016 – and who may be trying to avoid that aforementioned campaign literature – voted 63-2 this week to suspend Dayton’s pay increases. The effort was led by DFL Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk of Cook. Now, Dayton says he no longer trusts Bakk because Bakk stabbed him in the back.

18615	12	a	In his fifth State of the State address on Thursday, Gov. Mark Dayton repeated a lot of claims about the state’s economy and future. PoliGraph put three of those claims to the test and found two of the three to be correct. Here’s Dayton’s first claim about Minnesota’s economy. “More Minnesota businesses are expanding.  So, more Minnesotans are working.  They are earning more money, which means they are paying more taxes.” Dayton’s talking about the state’s most recent budget forecast. The report showed that more Minnesotans are working and earning higher wages, when not adjusted for inflation. That means more income and sales tax revenue for the state, which is a big driver behind Minnesota’s $1.9 billion budget surplus. PoliGraph rated a similar claim from Dayton accurate in the past, and we’re sticking with that rating. Dayton went on to talk about how Minnesota’s employment rate stacks up against the rest of the nation. “Our unemployment rate is an unusually low, 3.7%…. Minnesota is the only state in the nation, whose employment rate for 25-54 year-olds in 2014 exceeded its pre-recession level in 2007.” Dayton is correct that the state’s unemployment rate is 3.7 percent – lower than the national average of 5.5 percent. He’s also referring to a study from the Pew Charitable Trusts that compared 2014 employment rates in every state with employment rates prior to the recession. The study focused on 25-54 year-olds because those are considered prime working years, according to Pew’s website. Dayton is mostly correct that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that has an employment rate that’s higher than before the economy tanked. But the rate change is only slightly better than before the recession, and the Pew study doesn’t consider it statistically significant. Lastly, Dayton touched on the state’s education funding. “A rank of 24th in per-pupil K-12 education expenditures by a state with the 11th highest per-capita income means that at least thirteen other states are making greater financial efforts than we are to educate our children.” Back in January, Dayton made a similar claim about Minnesota’s per-pupil spending, but Poligraph gave it an inconclusive because the most recent numbers available are a few years old. That means the latest rankings don’t include Dayton’s more recent investments in education, like funding for all-day kindergarten. This claim comes with another important note: Minnesota actually ranks 15th in per capita income according to the latest Census data. A few years ago, Minnesota ranked 11th in the nation.

Take a recent ad paid for by the American Action Network, a conservative group spearheaded by former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman. The ad is running in the 8th Congressional District, which is represented by democrat Rick Nolan. It centers on cuts to Medicare Advantage plans, which are offered by private companies approved by Medicare. Messages about the program are meant to resonate with elderly voters, who tend to show up on Election Day. “For the second year in a row, the Obama administration has proposed deep rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage seniors rely on. Call Rep. Nolan and tell him to fight the President’s April 7th Medicare Advantage cuts,” the ad states. Meanwhile, flashing across the screen is this statement: “Rick Nolan voted against repealing Obamacare.”

In the midst of the crisis, legislators have discussed emergency funding to help poultry farmers deal with the outbreak, and have made a point to promote consumption of Minnesota turkeys. But one DFL legislator took to the House floor to give a bizarre speech about why he’s worried about the risk of humans getting avian flu. Rep. Ron Erhardt, DFL-Edina said that after eating turkey over the weekend “he was all flu-ed out” and referred to eating turkeys as “possible poison,” saying that there has been transference of avian flu to humans in the past.

21759	9	a	"I have never lobbied against sanctions personally... to my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/12/rex-tillerson/tillerson-misleads-russian-sanctions-opposition/	U.S. senators grilled former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson about his past dealings with Russia at his recent confirmation hearing to become secretary of state. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked Tillerson whether he thought Vladimir Putin was a war criminal (Tillerson's answer: I would not use that term""), while Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., pressed him on Exxon opposing sanctions against Russia. Senators have taken a hardline on Russia, both for its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine and its likely interference in the 2016 elections. Some, including Rubio, were keen supporters of economic sanctions against Russia in 2014. At that time, Exxon, with Tillerson at the helm, had struck joint venture deals with the Russian petro giant Rosneft to explore for oil across the country. Exxon estimated its exposure on those deals at $1 billion. Sanctions presented big problems for those investments. At his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, 2017, Tillerson rejected the assertion that he ever tried to scuttle sanctions. ""I have never lobbied against sanctions personally,"" Tillerson said. ""To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions."" That’s an artfully crafted answer that’s pretty misleading Government lobbying records show that in 2014 and 2015, Exxon paid the Nickles Group over $193,000 to press ""issues related to Russian sanctions impacting the energy sector,"" along with a number of other matters. It paid another $120,000 in 2014 and 2015 to Avenue Solutions for work on a range of issues, including ""energy sanctions in the Ukraine and Russia."" In the same time frame, according to public logs, Tillerson visited the White House five times to see Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council. The meetings started about a week after President Barack Obama authorized the first of three rounds of sanctions. Bloomberg reported that Tillerson saw Treasury Secretary Jack Lew seven times in the second half of 2014. The Treasury Department oversees how sanctions are carried out. That seems to directly contradict Tillerson’s statement, but Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers told us it didn’t. ""Exxon Mobil regularly engages with lawmakers and others to discuss the potential impact of sanctions and to express our view that sanctions should treat American companies fairly,"" Jeffers said. ""We do not express an opinion as to whether or not sanctions should be imposed; that is a decision for policy makers."" But at Exxon’s May 2014 shareholder meeting, Tillerson offered a more negative take on sanctions overall. He told reporters that sanctions are ""imprecise and ineffective."" and that ""our views are being heard at the highest levels,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. Oil industry experts told us it’s hard to believe that Exxon wouldn’t have opposed the sanctions. Tadeusz Patzek is a professor and petroleum industry analyst at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Patzek thinks Tillerson is a good choice for secretary of state, but he also said Exxon’s interests in Russia were quite clear. ""Russia is the last global frontier with big untapped oil resources that could be made available to Exxon,"" Patzek said. ""From this point of view, Exxon must have viewed the sanctions as unhelpful to the corporation."" Tim LaPira, a political scientist who studies lobbying at James Madison University, told us Tillerson’s claim is ""implausible."" ""The message of what sanctions would do would necessarily communicate that they were taking a clear position against them,"" LaPira said. ""If Exxon Mobil hired expensive lobbyists to communicate about sanctions, but not the corporation's position against them, then it seems to me they used shareholders' money to accomplish exactly nothing."" Government ethics advocate Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said, ""I doubt they would lobby for a bill that essentially cost them $1 billion."" Our ruling Tillerson said that he never lobbied against sanctions that targeted the Russian energy industry, nor to his knowledge had Exxon. But lobbying records show Exxon spent over $300,000 to argue its case on sanctions. Visitor records for the White House and the Treasury Department show Tillerson was a visitor when sanctions were being considered. An Exxon spokesperson said the company simply offered information on sanctions. But in 2014 Tillerson told reporters that he thought sanctions generally were ineffective and that he had let top government officials know what he thought of them.

Kathleen S. Connell, a former secretary of state and one-time teacher, testified before a joint meeting of the Senate and House Finance Committees on Oct. 26 that the plan to suspend annual cost-of-living increases for retirees would be especially onerous for those who don’t collect Social Security. Responding to a question posed by Senate Finance Chairman Daniel DaPonte about how many retirees don’t get Social Security, Connell said: I believe the figure is on the order of 60 percent of the state retirees -- which are the ones we are addressing -- don’t get Social Security.’’ Her statement prompted some head-shaking in the audience. So we decided to check it out. We contacted the Rhode Island AARP, and John Martin, the group’s spokesman, responded in an e-mail. ""This has been called to our attention,’’ Martin wrote. Martin said that while Connell did, indeed, say ""state retirees,"" she actually meant ""state teacher retirees [emphasis added] who do not collect Social Security."" That’s ""around 50 percent,"" he said. (The figure, he said, is based on data from the state Retirement System and the National Institute on Retirement Security, a nonprofit policy research organization in Washington.) But teachers were never specifically mentioned during the exchange, and we think anyone listening would assume, as we did, that Connell was referring to all retirees in the state-run plans that were being discussed. So we still wanted to know the answer to the Senate chairman’s question: How many state retirees don’t receive Social Security? The facts Social Security, the federal insurance program signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is designed to pay a post-retirement income to workers who contributed to the program. In 1950, Congress expanded Social Security coverage to state and local government employees not covered by other retirement plans; in 1954, the act was amended again to make it available to all state and local employees, except for police officers and firefighters. But state participation was voluntary. Massachusetts, for example, declined coverage for its public employees. Rhode Island opted into the Social Security system for most state workers, but made local participation optional. Participation requires contributions from both employers and employees. Some communities chose not to join. Others did sign on. The result is a patchwork system of coverage. As far as we could tell, no single agency in Rhode Island knows the precise number of retirees in the state system who are covered by Social Security -- not even the state Office of the General Treasurer, according to its spokeswoman, Joy Fox. But we did manage to get a good estimate. Here’s how we did it. The state retirement system comprises five separate pension plans. The largest has 11,421 retired state employees and beneficiaries (generally spouses or children), according to the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island June 30, 2010, actuarial report. All of them, Fox said, are covered by Social Security. The next largest plan covers teachers, with 10,213 retirees and beneficiaries, according to the same actuarial report. Based on the number of active teachers in each school district and the Social Security Agreements filed with the state, the treasurer’s office estimates that about half -- roughly 5,100 retired teachers -- are covered by Social Security. Teachers in 14 of the state’s 37 school districts -- including Providence, Pawtucket, North Providence, Warwick and Woonsocket -- are covered by Social Security, according to the Rhode Island Association of School Committees. Frank Flynn, president of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, whose members work for 11 of the 15 school districts, agrees with the treasurer’s estimate. After teachers, the next largest group of retirees in the state system -- just under 4,500 -- are local police, firefighters and municipal employees. The Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns reports its survey found that all municipal employees in Rhode Island are covered by Social Security. But that’s not the case with police and firefighters. In fact, several of the state’s larger, urban police and fire departments -- including Providence -- have no Social Security coverage, according to the League’s survey. With the help of one of our newsroom data gurus, we looked at the records of more than 4,000 retired municipal, police and firefighters and their beneficiaries (or 90 percent of that group) in the state system. We found that about 95 percent of them are covered by Social Security. So, all state employees, roughly half of all teachers and 95 percent of retired municipal, police and firefighters in the state retirement system get Social Security. The remaining two groups of retirees in the state system are judges and state police. All of the 81 retired judges and their beneficiaries get Social Security, according to Craig Berke, a spokesman for the state judiciary system. And none of the 266 retired state police are covered by Social Security. Add all the numbers up, and the share of retirees in the state-run plans who do get Social Security is about 78 percent. Even if we added in another 3,000 or so police and firefighters in municipally-run pension plans, almost all of whom don’t get Social Security, the overall percentage of those covered would still be 70 percent. (A week after Connell’s testimony, Mark Dingley, the state’s deputy treasurer, testified before the same committee that the share of current employees in state-run plans is about 75 percent.) The ruling Connell was clearly wrong when she said that 60 percent of ""state retirees"" don’t get Social Security. Our research found it’s about 22 percent. Connell’s spokesman said she meant retired teachers, not all retirees, although she didn’t make that distinction at the time. Even then, that number is 50 percent, not 60 percent. We rule Connell’s statement False. Correction: The initial version of this item reported that teachers in the City of Central Falls, R.I., were covered by Social Security. That was based on information from the Rhode Island Association of School Committees. After this item was published, the association said that it had made a mistake. In fact, Central Falls teachers are not covered by Social Security. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Because it’s shaping up to be a major campaign issue, this week’s installment of PoliGraph will look at two claims made about the new construction. First up, this statement from Republican state Rep. Kurt Zellers, who is seeking his party’s endorsement to challenge Gov. Mark Dayton this fall. “The $90 million dollar Senate Legislative Office Building and parking ramp the Democrats snuck through the legislature last year is a disaster zone of reckless spending, and Governor Dayton and the DFL-controlled legislature think it’s a good idea,” Zellers wrote in a fundraising letter. “We’re already one of the highest taxed states in the U.S., and yet Governor Dayton just keeps adding to the tab by allowing our tax dollars to be used to build a $90 million complex that won’t even hold all the senators it’s being built for.”

25628	63	a	After intense speculation that he would end his political career, 7th Congressional District Rep. Collin Peterson announced earlier this week that he would seek a 13th term. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which raises and spends money to maintain a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, has been salivating over Peterson’s seat for some time now because the 7th District leans Republican. With Peterson’s announcement, the NRCC is now trying to make the case that Peterson has overstayed his welcome in Congress by pointing out that he’s flip-flopped on congressional term limits. Here’s what the group said in a recent press release: Peterson has voiced his support for 12-year term limits in the past and even voted for a term limits constitutional amendment … In 2010, Peterson also signed the U.S. Term Limits Amendment Pledge – 20 years after he first ran for Congress.

Since 2011, K-12 education has been cut by over $1 billion, the UW system has lost nearly $800 million in state aid, and the Wisconsin Technical College System has lost over $200 million in state aid.” Wright is running against incumbent Republican Rep.

Among other things, the legislation would require companies with government contracts to certify that they pay men and women equally, and require employers to be more flexible with pregnant and nursing mothers. State Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, sponsored the bill. She argued on the Senate floor that protecting female employees is critical for the economy because their salaries are more and more likely to their household’s primary source of income. “Fifty percent of the state’s working mothers are the primary breadwinner for their family, as the sole earner or earning more than their spouse,” Pappas said. She went on to add that, “the pay gap is stuck at about 20 percent, that is women earning 80 percent of what men do on average.”

Mark Dayton’s administration and legislators, including DFLers in the Senate. It came down to this: Should the Legislature set aside millions to fund pre-kindergarten in all public schools or boost overall school spending and target other dollars to families who are least likely to be able to afford quality early education? Ultimately, Dayton and legislators settled on the latter option, passing a $17 billion education bill. But in the final hours of the special session, Rep. Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center, said the money isn’t well spent in the first place. “It’s a great babysitting service.
