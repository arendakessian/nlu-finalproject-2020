Comey sent a letter to Congress Oct. 28 saying the FBI may have found new emails relevant to its probe into Clinton’s private email server that she used while secretary of state. The FBI plans to review these new emails to see if they contain classified information. Back in July, Comey said the FBI recommended that no charges be brought in this case. With just over a week to go until the Nov. 8 election, the Clinton campaign has said they are concerned that Comey’s vague letter will fuel unfounded rumors about the email investigation, so he should make available any additional information the FBI has. ""We've made it very clear that, if they are going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people,"" Clinton said at an Oct. 28 press conference. ""And that's what I expect to happen."" Clinton was incorrect to say that the letter ""only"" went to Republican members of the House of Representatives. Democrat members received the letter, too. The letter was addressed at the top to the chairmen of various congressional committees, who are all currently Republican because the party controls both the Senate and the House.

Now CNN has its shot to match or beat the 24 million viewers that tuned in for round one. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt will be part of the CNN panel firing questions at the candidates, and Hewitt argues that they’d better do well now before the American public begins tuning out. ""Someone needs to break out of the pack if they're going to catch up to Donald Trump,"" Hewitt said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 13, 2015. ""So, they got to throw some long balls. The NFL starts this weekend. It's going to quickly subsume a lot of the attention span of the country. So, this is really the last opportunity for the 10 not named Donald to try and make themselves the alternative to Donald Trump."" In an op-ed titled ""Why Wednesday’s GOP presidential debates will matter,"" Hewitt made a similar point. ""The arrival of tailgating and of fall temps will also drop the temps of the campaign rhetoric,"" he wrote. ""Competition sets in for the Trump Show, and it won’t come from Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker. It will come from SportsCenter."" We wondered if fall sports really does drive down interest in politics. We ran the question by Hewitt, live on his radio show, and he said it stands to reason that interest in politics will suffer because people have a finite amount of time to consume media. ""If we look at the fact that the NFL is by far the most popular sport, the ratings for the World Series, especially when they feature the Cleveland Indians are very very high, therefore it must stand to reason that there is less time for politics because we spend so much time on sports,"" Hewitt said. ""My proposition, and it’s merely my argument, is it has to be true that Americans have less time to spend on politics between now and Christmas then they have had up until this point."" In terms of hard information, however, the polling data undermines Hewitt’s assertion. Going back to 2007, the Pew Research Center has been asking people if they follow various news stories ""very closely, fairly closely, not too closely, or not at all closely."" One of the stories the interviewers list is the election. They would do this nearly every week, with a hefty sample of over 1,000 people. Here are the trends in 2007 and 2011 (at this point in the election cycle four and eight years ago) for people who said they followed election news very or fairly closely: Source: Pew Research Center via Roper Center for Public Opinion Research There are some ups and downs by a handful of percentage points, but overall, about 45 to 55 percent of the public (depending on the year) said they were following the election, with perhaps a slight increase through the season. The surveys took place in slightly different weeks but both years saw dips during October. The one in 2011 happened to coincide with the World Series (the St. Louis Cardinals won in the seventh game). In 2007, it was around the period of the American League Championship Series. Whatever might explain the sudden drops, interest recovered immediately. Hewitt discounted the Pew data because it gets at his point indirectly. ""Unless they ask the specific question, ‘Does your political consumption go down as your football consumption goes up’, you are guessing,"" he said. We couldn’t find a political scientist who specifically studied whether football and baseball reduce Americans’ appetite for politics. One analyst of public polling, Thomas Holbrook at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said he has no hard data, but he’s skeptical of the premise. ""I do doubt, however, that football is going to knock the presidential contest off the front page, to use an archaic reference,"" Holbrook said. ""If nothing else, we have had baseball and summer vacation during the most recent period, neither of which seemed to diminish the importance of the campaign."" John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, said there’s some evidence that public engagement remains robust through the fall. ""There is precedent for lots of poll movement after this point,"" Sides said. ""There was certainly some in 2011, including surges for (Herman) Cain and (Newt) Gingrich."" Sports and election viewing is not a zero sum game In our interview, Hewitt assumed that there is a finite time for consuming media and that football must compete with politics. Put simply, if you’re watching sports, that’s less time for you to pay attention to the election. But, of course, it is possible to give up time spent on another activity, such as washing the car, to watch football. Also, the importance Hewitt places on football and baseball viewership assumes that those people would otherwise have been paying attention to the primaries. But it’s likely at least some of those diehard sports fans didn’t follow election coverage in the first place. (Remember, only about 50 percent of respondents say they are closely following the election news.) Our ruling Hewitt said fall sports pull voters away from paying attention to the presidential primaries. The polling data from 2007 and 2011 shows that voter interest in election news held steady at about the 50 percent mark. There were brief dips in October that coincided with the American League Championship one year and the World Series the next, but both were only momentary interruptions. The data don’t measure the precise trade-off between politics and sports, but the stability of the audience for election news shows no impact of any external factor, whether it’s sports, weather or anything else.

69,pomt-03236,"Many uninsured Americans are ""young.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-young-people-are-major-part-uninsur/,"During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. In the interview, Paul said many of the uninsured are young people. Paul, an eye surgeon, strongly opposed President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance. Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics, ""85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people."" In this item, we’ll check whether the uninsured are predominantly young. In separate items, we’ll look at whether cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans and whether half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. We’ll start by noting that it’s tricky to interpret Paul’s phrasing. One interpretation is that he said uninsured Americans making at least $50,000 are primarily young. Another is that he means that uninsured Americans are disproportionately young, regardless of income level. We didn't get an answer from Paul's staff about which of these he had intended, so we’ll look at both scenarios. Before doing that, we’ll note that the age of uninsured Americans is important because young people have particular insurance needs that are distinct from those of middle-aged and older Americans. Since young people tend to be healthy, they are more likely to be tempted by the option of not buying insurance, particularly if they do not work for a company that offers subsidized insurance. Many young people are averse to paying for the kind of comprehensive coverage attractive to middle-aged Americans and those with families, since young, healthy people aren’t necessarily going to the doctor very often. And this makes it harder to devise policies that push younger people into buying insurance. As Paul put it in the interview, ""They don't need low deductibles. They need very high deductibles. They need insurance for catastrophes, because young people are unlikely to get ill. They need it for the rare occasion, not the everyday occasion."" Are higher-income uninsured Americans mostly young? According to Census Bureau data, uninsured Americans with family incomes above $50,000 break down as follows: Children up to 18: 17 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 19 to 29: 27 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 30-39: 17 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 40-64: 38 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 (Anyone 65 and older automatically gets Medicare and thus cannot be uninsured. This census data was calculated and provided to PolitiFact by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.) So about one-quarter of the better-off uninsured are age 19 to 29 -- the age range most people probably think of when they hear the phrase ""young"" in the context of health insurance. Using a broader age range -- from 19 to 39 -- the share rises to 44 percent. That’s a significant percentage, but it’s short of a majority. Are uninsured Americans overall mostly young? Here’s how uninsured Americans break down by age, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of Census Bureau data: Age 0-18: 15.9 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 19-25: 17.3 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 26-34: 21.4 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 35-44: 17.5 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 45-54: 16.4 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 55-64: 11.5 percent of all uninsured Americans So, the percentage of the uninsured who are between ages 19 and 25 is 17.3 percent, while the percentage of the uninsured who are between 19 and 34 is 38.7 percent. That means that ""young"" Americans comprise a significant minority of the uninsured population, though still not a majority. That said, younger people are statistically more likely to be uninsured than either children or middle-aged Americans. Here are the percentages of people in specific age ranges who are uninsured: Age 0-18: 9.7 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 19‐25: 27.9 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 26‐34: 27.8 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 35‐44: 21.2 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 45‐54: 17.9 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 55‐64: 14.6 percent of people in this age range are uninsured In other words, if you’re a young person, you are more likely to be uninsured than children or middle-aged Americans are. However, if you look at uninsured Americans in the big picture, young people are not the biggest part. Children and middle-aged Americans, combined, account for a larger share of the uninsured population. Our ruling Paul said that many uninsured Americans are ""young."" He’s right that significant numbers of young people lack insurance, and that young people are statistically more likely to be uninsured than either children or middle-aged Americans are. However, it’s worth noting that within the universe of uninsured Americans, young people are not close to a majority. Collectively, children and the middle-aged account for a greater share of the uninsured.

71,pomt-02583,On sharing power with Republicans,full flop,/virginia/statements/2014/jan/29/virginia-senate-democratic-caucus/senate-democrats-u-turn-power-sharing/,"Democrats’ views on power sharing in the state Senate have come a long way. Each political party controls 20 seats in the state Senate, just like they did two years ago. But the the Democrats senators’ view has hardened now that they have the tie-breaking vote. Let’s go back to November 2011 elections when Republicans gained two Senate seats, splitting the partisan count in the chamber down the middle and setting the stage for GOP Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling to cast tie-breaking votes on legislation. A few weeks later, Republicans decreed that Bolling’s tie-breaking vote also applied to Senate rules and that with his support, they would they would push through a reorganization that would give the GOP chairmanship of all committees. Democrats protested, saying Bolling’s tie-breaking powers did not give him a say in establishing the internal rules of the Senate. Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, said ""Bolling is not a member of the Senate,"" and unsuccessfully asked a judge to stop the reorganization. McEachin, the chairman of the chamber’s Democratic caucus, denounced the GOP’s reorganization as ""an arrogant power grab."" Sen. Richard L. Saslaw, a Fairfax County Democrat who stood to lose his post as majority leader, agreed. ""Virginians elected 20 senators of each party, and it’s only right the power in the Senate is divided equally,"" Saslaw told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""The Republicans are trying to overrule the will of the people and claim a majority they did not earn."" On Jan. 11, 2012, Senate Republicans, with Bolling’s support, pushed through a resolution giving their party chairmanships of all the committees and majority membership on the major panels. The measure passed on a 21-20 vote. ""It’s grossly unfair to the citizens of Virginia who voted for a 20-20 Senate,"" said Sen. John S. Edwards, D-Roanoke, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""I think the citizens of Virginia want the Senate of Virginia to engage in a power-sharing agreement."" But Republicans were not sympathetic. Sen. Tommy Norment, who was poised to become the new majority leader, said the reorganization was a ""rearticulation of Senate rules"" that the GOP found ""appropriate."" Now, let’s flash forward. In November 2013, Democrat Ralph Northam was elected lieutenant governor. And this Monday, Democrat Lynwood Lewis was declared the winner of a special election to take Northam’s seat in the Senate. On Tuesday, Lewis was sworn in, giving Democrats a 21-20 edge with Northam’s tie-breaking vote. That allowed the Democrats to push through their own reorganization on a series of 21-20 votes. Democrats gave themselves the leadership of all committees -- although it should be noted they agreed to share the chairmanship of the powerful Finance Committee with Republican Walter Stosch, a bipartisan gesture the GOP was unwilling to make two years ago. Echoing Republican actions of 2012, the Democrats gave themselves majorities on all committees but two: Local Government; and Rehabilitation and Social Services. Republicans, perhaps mindful of their actions two years ago, did not call on the Democrats to share power or contest the lieutenant governor’s right to break the tie votes. But they did complain about several new precedents the Democrats set, including one that would empower the Rules Committee to kill Senate bills that are ""significantly amended"" by the Republican-led House of Delegates. In the past, House amendments to Senate bills were considered by the full Senate. The Democrats’ reorganization plan was authored by McEachin -- the same person who called the GOP takeover two years ago ""an arrogant power grab."" McEachin said his change of view this year is rooted in the GOP’s actions two years ago. During debate, he frequently repeated Norment’s 2012 line about ""a rearticulation of Senate rules."" Saslaw, in a written statement after the vote, said time have changed. ""We now have a majority and we have a responsibility to use that majority to work on the issues voters care about,"" he wrote. No doubt, the Senate Democrats have U-turned on power sharing. We rate it a ""Full Flop."" Correction: A comment made by Sen. Richard Saslaw was incorrectly attributed to Sen. Donald McEachin in an earlier version of this story.

73,pomt-05108,"""Obamacare is . . . the largest tax increase in the history of the world.""",pants on fire!,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/rush-limbaugh/health-care-law-not-largest-tax-increase-us-histor/,"A silver lining for conservatives in the Supreme Court’s health care decision Thursday is that the court allowed the law to stand based on the idea that the individual mandate was a tax. That news has Republicans and conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh bringing out an old -- and incorrect claim -- that the health care law constitutes the largest tax increase ever. Rep. Connie Mack, a Republican from Florida running for the U.S. Senate, called it ""the largest tax on the American people in history"" in a press release. Florida GOP congressional candidate state Rep. Gary Aubuchon said on Twitter that the ""ruling confirms Obamacare is the largest tax increase in U.S. history. U.S. Rep. Jeff Landry, R-Pa., put it this way: ""This is the largest tax increase on the poor and the middle class in the history of this country""; and Alabama Republican Party chair Bill Armistead said that ""The United States Supreme Court has essentially created the largest tax increase in American history."" Then there's Limbaugh, who turned up the rhetoric on radio the way only he can. Forget the United States,""Obamacare is nothing more than the largest tax increase in the history of the world,"" he declared. This claim is wrong. While the health care law certainly is, on the whole, a tax increase, it’s not the largest in American history -- and as such -- cannot be the largest in the history of the world. (Luckily, there's enough U.S.-based research that we don't have to explore the tax increases of the Roman Empire, adjusted for inflation.) We addressed this more than a year ago. But here’s a refresher. Major tax provisions The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, provided members a detailed breakdown of the tax impact of the health care law from 2010-2019. • Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans"" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, there's a new fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2013, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices starts. The 10-year total: $20 billion. • Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. • Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. There also is money in the law going the other way. The plan includes government money, in the form of tax credits, to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower-income people who don't get insurance through their employer. For the record, many Republicans and tax experts argue those shouldn't count as tax cuts. And there is a tax cut for some very small businesses that allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees. Combined with various other revenue-generating provisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenues coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019. Does that translate to the biggest tax increase in American history? Comparing tax impacts of legislation First, we need to set some goal posts. There are many ways to define or measure the size of a tax increase, and not all tax increases have been measured the same way over time. The health care tax provisions, for instance, take effect between 2011 and 2018, meaning the full effect of the legislation won't be felt until near the end of the decade. On top of that, it doesn't make sense to compare 2019 dollars to 1985 dollars. You have to adjust for inflation, or express the amount as a total of Gross Domestic Product at the time, which is a way to measure the relative impact of a tax provision at the time it was enacted. To make matters even more complicated, there are tax cuts that are direct results of tax increases, and vice-versa. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), for example, was passed largely to reverse revenue losses from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA). For our comparison, we used a method perfected by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940-2006. He used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation and calculated the impact as a percentage of GDP. For 1940-1967 calculations, he used a single-year snapshot of the revenue impact of the tax legislation. For more recent tax bills, from 1968-2006, Tempalski used a two-year average of the revenue effects. Tempalski wrote: ""The comparison of tax bills for the first period should be examined with some caution, because the revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. The comparison for the second period can be viewed with more confidence, because the estimates are relatively consistent."" As a percent of GDP, here are the top five tax increases from 1940-2006, according to Tempalski: 1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP; 2. Revenue Act of 1941: 2.2 percent of GDP; 3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP; 4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP; 5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: .97 percent of GDP; And here are the top five tax increases from the ""modern"" era of 1968-2006: 1. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP; 2. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: .8 percent of GDP; 3(t): Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: .5 percent of GDP 3(t): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; .5 percent of GDP; 5: Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; .49 percent of GDP. The 2010 health care law The list obviously does not include the health care law, which passed in 2010, and a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury says it hasn't been updated. So we calculated our own percent of GDP figure. We used 2019 as our baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of the law will be in effect. In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion. We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to .49 percent of total GDP. Depending on your rounding, that would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. The health care-related tax increases are smaller than the tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961. The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993. But they are not the largest in the history of the United States. And -- despite what Limbaugh said -- that means they cannot be the largest ever in the history of world. Limbaugh's inflated rhetoric takes a wrong claim and puts it into the realm of the ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE: Some readers noticed that our initial analysis of Limbaugh’s claim failed to include references to the penalty that people who declined to purchase health insurance would be asked to pay. After all, the Supreme Court declared that penalty a tax. The CBO figure we used for our calculation, a total of $104 billion in revenue generated in 2019, is inclusive of all revenues, including the penalty or tax individuals might pay if they do not purchase health insurance. The figure for that year was estimated to be $14 billion for penalties paid for by employees and individuals.

74,pomt-02658,"""Sens. Isakson’s, Chambliss’ Votes Against Unemployment Insurance Were Votes to Kill Nearly 6,000 Georgia Jobs.""",half-true,/georgia/statements/2014/jan/14/americans-united-change/group-claims-georgia-jobs-risk-if-benefits-not-ext/,"When lawmakers returned to Congress after the new year, Democrats and Republicans went back to their corners and began sparring over whether to extend unemployment benefits. Georgia’s two U.S. senators, Republicans Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, both opposed a Democratic-led $6.4 billion proposal to extend the benefits, which expired Dec. 28. Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group, promptly sent out a press release decrying the senators’ votes. The group included a claim about the economic impact to Georgia about extending those benefits that put PolitiFact Georgia and its Truth-O-Meter to work. ""Sens. Isakson’s, Chambliss’ Votes Against Unemployment Insurance Were Votes to Kill Nearly 6,000 Georgia Jobs,"" Americans United for Change wrote in the headline. Is that true, we wondered? Georgians now are eligible for a maximum of 18 weeks of state-based unemployment insurance, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Congress typically enacts extended federal benefits during recessions, and the expired benefits ran for a maximum of 47 additional weeks. Chambliss and Isakson have supported a GOP proposal to pay for a $6.4 billion long-term unemployment insurance extension and to restore $6 billion in cost-of-living increases for early military pensions. They would pay for that by preventing illegal immigrants from claiming a tax credit for their children. Americans United for Change based its claim on a report on the White House website pushing the extension. Called ""The Economic Benefits of Extending Unemployment Benefits,"" the report outlines how many jobs would be saved in 2014 by continuing the insurance. In Georgia, the total was 5,876. Nationally, the impact is 240,000 jobs, the report says. The report was written by the U.S. Labor Department and the Council of Economic Advisors. Without the additional unemployment insurance, many of those jobless workers would seek help from other federal programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the food stamp program. White House officials pointed to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to support the claim. The CBO released a report in December that concluded extending unemployment benefits through the end of 2014 would add about 200,000 jobs nationwide. That estimate is slightly lower but pretty close to the report on the White House website. The CBO and White House reports use the amount of money spent in each state from unemployment insurance and estimate how many jobs it will create or save. Unemployment benefits have a trickle-down effect on the economy, some say. The money those unemployed recipients receive in benefits is used to buy groceries and other services that keep others employed or can create additional jobs. ""Who provides goods and services? Workers,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist for the Economic Policy Institute, a generally left-leaning, Washington-based nonprofit that supports extending the benefits. The institute has done its own research on the topic. It concluded 310,000 jobs would be created. Shierholz, who co-wrote the report, said her group used federal data and added a multiplier to come up with its estimate. Shierholz said the Obama administration report used what she described as ""standard"" methodology to come up with its estimate. ""Their overall numbers make sense,"" Shierholz told us. University of Georgia professor Jeffrey Dorfman was not so convinced about the effectiveness of extending the benefits. He said if you believe that deficit spending will boost the economy, ""then the methodology used is correct and reasonably well done."" ""I personally think these models far overstate the benefits of deficit spending because they do not account for the cost of the lost spending by whoever would have borrowed the money if the government hadn't borrowed it first,"" Dorfman said via email. ""We see the benefits of the government spending but do not see the jobs that would have been created in the private sector instead."" He also questioned the logic of extending the benefits. ""Extended unemployment payments are currently scored at $6.5 billion for a 3 month extension. If we figure $26 billion for the whole year versus the 240,000 jobs that the White House says will be ‘saved or created’ by that spending, that works out to $108,333 per job,"" Dorfman said. ""Clearly, we would be better off if the federal government just randomly picked 240,000 long term unemployed people and gave them government jobs at say $40,000 per year."" To sum up, Americans United for Change claimed extending unemployment benefits would save nearly 6,000 Georgia jobs this year. The claim was based on a federal report. Other nationwide estimates suggest the jobs number in the report is on target. But it is still an estimate that’s based on economic projections. And the overreaching point by American United for Change neglects the fact that Isakson and Chambliss back a GOP plan that would also extend jobless benefits. With those caveats, we rate this claim Half True.",None,Americans United for Change,None,None,None,2014-01-14T00:00:00,2014-01-14,['None']
75,pomt-06622,"""Poverty among Americans 65 and over is statistically unchanged"" in recent years because of Social Security.",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/19/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-said-social-security-keeping-older-a/,"The most recent census numbers show poverty is on the rise. Median household incomes have fallen to their lowest level since the 1990s, prompting analysts to say we are in the midst of a ""lost decade."" Liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow reviewed the numbers on her prime-time show on MSNBC: The news that the U.S. poverty rate is now the highest it has been since the early '90s, nearly one in six Americans now living in poverty. And the specifics are even worse: Child poverty rose from under 21 percent to 22 percent. Poverty among Hispanic Americans went from more than 25 percent to more than 26 percent. Poverty among African-Americans went from just under 26 percent to over 27 percent. Poverty among white people is much lower than those other groups but it is rising, too, and fast. It went up from 9.4 percent to 9.9 percent. The only large segment of the American population that serves as any sort of silver lining in these poverty numbers is older Americans. Poverty among Americans 65 and over is statistically unchanged, even as it is getting so much worse for so many other groups of people. And that, of course, is because we have something in this country that keeps older Americans out of poverty. It's called Social Security. And the fact that Social Security works, that it is keeping old people out of poverty in America, even as everybody else is slipping into it, the fact that it works means that in Republicanland, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination is someone who says that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and a failure. We wondered if Maddow was right that Social Security is the main factor keeping older Americans out of poverty. We suspected the federal program likely played some role, but we also wondered what role traditional pensions played. So we decided to check it out. A review of how Social Security works: Workers contribute to the program via payroll taxes. (Most people are required to participate, with a few exceptions, such as retirement programs for government employees like those in Galveston County, Texas.) When workers reach retirement age, they file for Social Security benefits. The government calculates their benefits according to a formula primarily based on average lifetime earnings, and sends them monthly checks. They'll get that amount, with small increases for inflation, until they die. Social Security has become a political topic lately because officials project the program won't take in enough money to pay full benefits starting around 2036. Most people agree the program will have to be changed to make it more financially solid. Getting back to our fact-check, Maddow is right that the poverty rate for Americans over age 65 is quite stable. For 2010, it was at 9 percent, up slightly from 8.9 percent in 2009, and lower than it was during the 1990s, when it reached a decade-high 12.9 percent in 1992. Next, we wanted to know how much Social Security made a difference to seniors with relatively low incomes: Quite a bit, it turns out. The Social Security Administration performs economic analysis and publishes research statistics for Americans over age 65. The latest research available is for 2008, but Melissa Favreault, an expert on Social Security with the Urban Institute, told us she didn't expect the percentages would be significantly different for 2010. The Social Security Administration looks at taxpayers aged 65 and older, dividing them up by income into five groups, from the lowest earning group to the highest. (For you non-policy wonks out there, these five groups are known as quintiles.) The numbers show that the less income people have, the more they depend on Social Security. Meanwhile, people who get pensions tend to be in the higher earning groups. Meanwhile, the Census Bureau stated in its recent report that Social Security was keeping millions of people out of poverty: ""In 2010, the number of people aged 65 and older in poverty would be higher by almost 14 million if Social Security payments were excluded from money income, quintupling the number of elderly people in poverty."" If you added 14 million additional seniors to those already in poverty in 2010, the poverty rate for American over age 65 would be 45 percent, not 9 percent. We also found a 2008 report on Social Security from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that analyzed ways to improve the future financing of Social Security. The report starts: ""Social Security has significantly reduced elderly poverty. The elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35% in 1959 to an all-time low of 9% in 2006, in large part because of Social Security. If Social Security benefits did not exist, an estimated 44% of the elderly would be poor today assuming no changes in behavior."" Still, there are a few other things to consider when evaluating Maddow's statement. Some seniors get public assistance from federal, state and local programs, particularly if they are poor or disabled. Those programs also have a role in keeping low-income seniors out of poverty. (Going back to the Social Security statistics that analyze quintiles, about 8 percent of the lowest quintile receives 50 percent or more of its income from public assistance.) Health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid could also indirectly increase people's income by paying for health care costs that they might otherwise pay out of pocket. Then there's the argument to be made that some Social Security beneficiaries would have saved the money on their own, in other more productive ways. We fact-checked Ed Schultz's statement on what poverty numbers might look like if Social Security had never existed, and looked in some detail at different scenarios. Finally, Social Security is not specifically aimed at keeping people out of poverty; many middle and upper-class people benefit as well. Social Security payments are based on people's lifetime earnings, so the more people earned during their working years, the more they get from Social Security. However, Social Security is progressive in the sense that low earners get more back in benefits than they contribute via payroll taxes. Andrew Biggs, an expert on Social Security with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that Social Security isn't particularly effective if looked at solely as an antipoverty program. ""In 2010, Social Security spent over $575 billion on retirement and survivors benefits, which comes to $14,675 for each person over age 65 –- enough to give every person a benefit that's 50 percent above the poverty line,"" said Biggs. ""And yet we still have 10 percent of seniors in poverty. If reducing poverty was our only goal, we could do a lot more while spending a lot less than we do."" In rating Maddow's statement, she's largely correct that Social Security keeps a significant number of older Americans out of poverty. But other programs also play a role.

One claims that Democrat Amanda Murphy is out of touch with average voters and wouldn't be available, literally, because she'll be at her ""Cancun vacation home."" The other says Republican Bill Gunter would ""drain millions"" from public education and give the money to for-profit schools. With the House District 36 election set for Oct. 15, 2013, PolitiFact Florida decided to test the accuracy of these noteworthy mailers. Here, we'll examine the ad targeting Gunter's view on public education, which showed up in mailboxes a couple weeks ago. (We'll look at the attack against Murphy in a separate fact-check.) ""Gunter would drain millions from local public schools, and give our tax dollars to private, for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations,"" the ad says. The Florida Democratic Party financed the mailer. It cites aTimes article, a preview of the Republican primary, published Sept. 13. In the story, three Republicans seeking the nomination weighed in on whether funding to public schools should be increased. Gunter said he opposed increased state funding for education and suggested the private sector play a larger role, a statement he alluded to at least twice before: at a Sept. 4 candidates debate and in a questionnaire, where he stated: ""Money isn't the issue. . . . Highest per pupil spending districts are some of the worst in the nation."" None of his statements referenced ""for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations."" Joshua Karp, spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said freezing educational spending at its present level would result in cuts to Pasco schools to offset rising expenses. Also, diverting state funding to the private sector, or charter schools, takes away money from public schools, he said. Olga Swinson, chief financial officer for Pasco schools and the past president of Florida School Finance Officers Association, said a state funding freeze might result in budget cuts if costs for salaries, pensions, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other services go up at the same time. Many of those costs have indeed increased in recent years, leading to cuts. ""With every fund that we have, we would have to make do or we would have to start cutting programs,"" she said. Whether those cuts would amount to ""draining millions"" from the district is debatable, but Swinson wouldn't rule out the possibility and explained that the depth of cuts would depend on how much insurance, maintenance, pensions and other costs increase. Enrollment levels and local revenue streams would influence spending as well. Additionally, there's little evidence to the Democrats' claim that earmarking state funds to charter schools would enrich ""for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations."" Most of the seven charter schools operating in Pasco are locally owned. The Imagine Charter School of Land O'Lakes is owned by a Virginia-based company. The ad makes broad assumptions that district costs would swell by millions of dollars, leading to cuts, that local revenues wouldn't keep pace and that charter schools owned by out-of-state companies would get tax money. That's a lot of assuming. Still, history shows that education costs are consistently on the rise.

77,pomt-01306,"Greg Abbott has benefitted from ""payday lenders who have given him $300,000 and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees.""",mostly true,/texas/statements/2014/oct/29/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-said/,"Wendy Davis, asked if she’s unethically profited while in public office, suggested her opponent has committed infractions including one that resulted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations. Responding to a reporter at the Sept. 30, 2014, gubernatorial debate in Dallas, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee and Fort Worth state senator accused Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, her Republican foe, of selling out Texans to serve the ""interests of people who make donations to his campaign."" As an example, Davis pointed out ""payday lenders who have given"" Abbott’s campaign ""$300,000 and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees."" Davis was revisiting a topic she’s consistently explored: that a 2006 letter from Abbott’s state office allowed payday lenders to skirt state lending laws. After Davis’ proclaimed link between Abbott’s campaign donations and official action was described by the El Paso Times in January 2014, we found Half True her statement that Texas payday lenders were charging 1,000 percent interest. In rare instances, lenders charged 1,000 percent annual interest, but payday loan rates then averaged 465 percent. For this fact check, we gauged whether Abbott piled up hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations and then issued a ruling favorable to payday lenders, which offer low-dollar, high-interest short-term loans targeting low-income people who live paycheck to paycheck. The loans are generally for $100 and $500 and are most often issued for two weeks. They’re considered risky because low-income borrowers are relatively unlikely to be able to pay them back. Abbott campaign contributions To our inquiry about the $300,000 described as given to Abbott, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas emailed us records of Abbott campaign contributions as filed in campaign reports at the Texas Ethics Commission covering Sept. 16, 2002 nearly through July 2014. Our own sampling of state records showed Abbott’s campaign fielded: --$80,000 from Trevor Ahlberg, CEO of Irving-based payday lender Cash Store, in eight installments from Aug. 16, 2006 to June 16, 2014; --$57,500 from Roderick Aycox, founder of Georgia-based payday lender LoanMax, in five installments from Nov. 12, 2009 to June 9, 2014; --$30,500 from Cash America International Inc. PAC in 14 contributions from Sept. 16, 2002 to July 29, 2014; --$30,000 from Ace Cash Express Inc. PAC, in eight donations from Oct. 5, 2005 to July 29, 2014. Then again, according to Petkanas and state records, less than 5 percent of the tallied payday-lender donations, or $13,000, had come in by Jan. 12, 2006, which was the date Abbott’s office issued the ruling criticized by Davis. By phone, Petkanas said Davis did not mean to say in the debate that all the $300,000 was given before Abbott’s office ruled on payday lending. Texas Payday Lenders: Regulation and Evasion There's a lot of background to state actions involving payday lenders. In 1999, then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, Abbott’s predecessor, filed lawsuits against selected payday lenders, saying the companies were dodging state laws regulating interest rates. Separately, a ""usury"" provision in the Texas Constitution caps interest rates on short-term loans from unlicensed lenders at 10 percent. Cornyn, saying lenders were getting away with interest rates of up to 1,000 percent, said: ""This kind of abusive payday lending is illegal in Texas, and those companies who continue this practice will face serious consequences."" An October 2000 report by the Sunset Advisory Commission found that ""in recent years, different types of lending businesses have attempted to evade regulation"" including payday lenders. It recommended the Legislature ""authorize"" the ""Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner to regulate payday loans"" in order to ""help control unlawful interest rates."" In 2001, state lawmakers agreed to changes in law bringing payday lending under the office’s regulation and directing the Texas Finance Commission to adopt rules guiding the industry. According to a May 2001 bill analysis by the House Research Organization, the requested rules ""would prohibit a lender from using a device, pretense, or subterfuge to avoid regulation of the lender’s transactions, including by recharacterizing fees on a loan as a purchase of a good or service."" Resulting additions to Texas law include a chart specifying acceptable fees for payday loans of various dollar amounts and durations. But in subsequent years, according to Austin American-Statesman news reports, Texas payday lenders found a way around the law by partnering with out-of-state banks, which financed payday loans out of the reach of Texas laws. State and national legislators then raised concerns about payday lenders dodging the restrictions; the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation cracked down in 2005, limiting the number of payday loans a bank could issue and constricting the profitability of partnerships between payday lenders and banks. That’s when Texas payday lenders, under pressure from regulation, started transitioning to a new business model, called a credit service organization (CSO) in summer 2005, the Statesman reported In January 2006. Its news story said Texas payday lenders ditched partnerships with FDIC-regulated banks and began working with ""third-party unregistered lenders."" It also said Texas ""payday lenders got a boost recently from Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott"" in the form of a letter affirming the legality of the CSO model. Between 2004 and 2014, payday lender storefronts increased more than tenfold in Texas, the El Paso Times reported Feb. 4, 2014. Abbott’s interpretation of state law Next, we looked at the Abbott ""ruling"" declared by Davis. It turned out to be an aide's legal analysis. In 2005, the attorney general’s office, headed by Abbott, fielded two requests to review the legality of payday-lender CSOs, agency spokesman Jerry Strickland said by email, one an August 2005 verbal request from the consumer credit commissioner, who inquired after a court case raised questions about whether the state had any sway over CSOs. In Lovick v. Ritemoney Ltd., the plaintiff accused payday lender Ritemoney Ltd. of disguising illegal interest fees as service charges. A state district judge, Rhesa Hawkins Barksdale, wrote that ""Texas law does not construe such credit service fees as disguised interest,"" and the complaint was dismissed. Strickland said the other request for Abbott’s judgment came in writing Sept. 8, 2005 from then-state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso. Shapleigh wrote that as a CSO, ""a payday lending company dodges both federal guidelines restricting payday loans and the interest-rate limits established by the Texas Finance Commission. As the state’s leading enforcement agency, it is imperative that your office investigate this new business model and take necessary enforcement actions against businesses purposefully and illegally skirting Texas laws."" On Jan. 12, 2006, Barry McBee, the state’s first assistant attorney general, signed a letter responding to the commissioner, Leslie Pettijohn, saying there was ""nothing patently illegal"" about payday lender CSOs under state law and there was no statutory limit to the fees they could charge. McBee’s letter pointed out that, in keeping with state law, payday lender CSOs were charging the maximum-permitted 10 percent interest on loans plus service fees to arrange the loan between a borrower and third-party lender. He wrote that, according to Chapter 393 of the Texas Finance Code, there is not ""any limit on the amount of fees"" a CSO can charge in such transactions. ""Any discussion of whether the use of this model is the best public policy choice for the State of Texas,"" McBee wrote, ""is one that must be addressed by the Legislature and has not been explored by this office."" Legislative Review In the 2013 legislative session, lawmakers debated reforming payday lending practices, but attempts stalled. Expert Analysis By phone, Don Baylor, a former senior policy analyst for the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, said that after the Lovick v. Ritemoney ruling, payday lenders remained uncertain if they could legally operate as CSOs. But, Baylor said, ""it’s fair to say the OAG letter provided enough regulatory certainty for the entire (payday lending) industry to jump on board with the CSO model."" Baylor also said that after the Lovick ruling, ""the attorney general doesn’t have the authority to prohibit loans from being made under the CSO model."" He credited the explosion of payday lender CSOs to ambiguous wording in the 1987 Credit Services Organization Act, which was written to help Texans improve credit scores and not with payday lenders in mind, he said. ""Payday lenders found the CSO costume and dressed up in the costume,"" said Baylor. ""It’s a very creative way they came up with to get around the constitutional usury limits."" Our Ruling Davis said payday lenders gave Abbott $300,000 in campaign donations ""and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees."" This statement references a 2006 legal analysis -- not a ruling -- from a top state aide to Abbott that tracked with a court ruling permitting payday lenders to charge unlimited fees in spite of state caps on related interest. Clarification is needed in that only 5 percent of the described $300,000 in donations occurred before the analysis was issued. Regardless, Abbott's office reaffirmed a way for politically supportive payday lenders to squeeze Texas borrowers. We rate this statement Mostly True.

In one Spanish-language radio ad, Gingrich calls Romney ""anti-immigrant."" (The Gingrich campaign said it was pulling the ad on Jan. 25, 2012, after Sen. Marco Rubio said it was unfair and not true.) In a rebuttal, Romney attacks Gingrich on radio as not being the Ronald Reagan conservative Gingrich claims. Romney also says that Gingrich said ""Spanish is the language of the ghetto."" Here’s a partial transcript of the ad, which is airing in South Florida (translation courtesy of Patricia Mazzei of the Miami Herald): ""Gingrich enriched himself with Freddie Mac, one of the principle companies responsible for the mortgage collapse that has caused so much damage in our community. Reagan would have never joined forces with Nancy Pelosi as Gingrich did for advancing the extreme left agenda. And Reagan would have never offended Hispanics as Gingrich did when he said Spanish is the language of the ghetto. Now, searching for votes, Gingrich wants to change history. But the facts speak for themselves. Paid for by Romney for President, Incorporated."" We’ve written about Gingrich’s relationship with Freddie Mac and Nancy Pelosi in other items. Here, we’re focusing on the claim that Gingrich said, ""Spanish is the language of the ghetto."" The claim comes from a speech Gingrich gave on March 31, 2007, to the National Federation of Republican Women, as he was considering running for president in 2008. We tracked down the speech in its entirety through C-SPAN, which originally broadcast the speech and has a wonderful video archive. You can watch Gingrich’s remarks by clicking here; the statements germane to this fact-check begin about 23 minutes in. ""Nobody in the elite world understands this, this is an enormous center-right country,"" Gingrich said. ""This was driven home for me a couple weeks ago when I was doing a press release for English First. They gave me some data. Eighty-five percent of the American people believe English should be the official language of government."" After breaking for applause, Gingrich continued, ""Now that's according to a Rasmussen poll. Zogby came back and said that's too high -- the number's 84. Gingrich then pivoted to the founding of the colony of Jamestown, ""when people who believed their rights came from God first stepped foot on this continent."" They had a ""very simple model,"" he said: ""We should replace bilingual education with immersion in English so people learn the common language of the country and so they learn the language of prosperity, not the language of living in a ghetto,"" Gingrich said. ""Second … we should establish that citizenship requires passing a test on American history in English. And if that's true, we do not have to print ballots in any language except English."" Gingrich’s comments were picked up that day by the Associated Press, which said Gingrich equated bilingual education with ""the language of living in a ghetto."" In looking at his remarks, he did not directly make that linkage -- his ""language of living in a ghetto"" is juxtaposed with ""the language of prosperity."" But the larger context, particularly the remark about ballot language, suggests that he was referring to Spanish. He was widely criticized for the comment. The AP article quoted Peter Zamora, co-chair of the Washington-based Hispanic Education Coalition, which supports bilingual education, as saying, ""The tone of his comments were very hateful. Spanish is spoken by many individuals who do not live in the ghetto."" On April 4, Gingrich posted a video on YouTube to explain the comments. He looked in the camera and spoke -- in Spanish. ""Last weekend I made some comments that I recognize produced a bad feeling within the Latino community,"" Gingrich said in Spanish (his comments in the video are subtitled into English). ""The words I chose to express myself were not the best, and what I wanted to say is this. In the United States it is important to speak English well in order to progress and have success. To achieve this goal, we should replace bilingual education programs with intensive English instruction courses and in this way permit that English be the language that all of us have in common. ""This is an expression of support for Latinos, not an attack on their language. I have never believed that Spanish is a language of people of low income nor a language without beauty."" Gingrich did not explicitly apologize for his comments in the web video. Gingrich was asked about the ""ghetto"" comment on Jan. 25, 2012, during an interview with Univision. He sidestepped the question in his answer. ""I said -- about all languages -- I am for English as the common, unifying language,"" he said. ""If I were going to live in Mexico, I would say that Spanish is really important for me to learn."" Our ruling A Romney radio ad playing in Spanish in South Florida claims that Gingrich said ""Spanish is the language of the ghetto."" In a speech in 2007, Gingrich said that some language other than English is the ""language of living in a ghetto.""

79,pomt-05814,"Says Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz ""opposes the DREAM Act, which is supported by 85% of Latinos.""",true,/texas/statements/2012/feb/21/texas-democratic-party/texas-democratic-party-says-ted-cruz-opposes-dream/,"In a Feb. 3, 2012, press release, a Texas Democratic Party spokeswoman charged Republicans with using the Latino community ""as a wedge to gain support from the extreme wing of their party."" Among the examples of what the release sarcastically calls ""GOP Latino-outreach efforts"" is this statement: ""Ted Cruz forcefully opposes the DREAM Act, which is supported by 85% of Latinos."" The DREAM Act — which stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors — would provide illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children a path to permanent residency if they attend college or serve in the military. The Democratic Party’s statement led us to a two-part fact-check. Let’s start with how Cruz, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, stands on the cited act. We didn’t have to look far. In a transcribed interview with blogger Sonja Harris of Conservatives in Action that Cruz has on his campaign website, the candidate says: ""I do not support the DREAM Act and categorically oppose amnesty. I categorically oppose amnesty, and I strongly support legal immigration for those that have followed the rules and come here to pursue the American dream."" In December 2010, the U.S. House, which then had a Democratic majority, approved a version of the act. The proposal did not make it through the Senate. Critics of the plan, including many Republicans, say it amounts to amnesty for some illegal immigrants. So, Cruz opposes the act. But is it supported by 85 percent of Latinos? Fortunately for us, PolitiFact Florida recently looked into a similar claim in an ad from the left-leaning political group Presente Action. Concentrating on polls, our colleagues found many national ones that looked at general public opinion on issues such as the DREAM Act, and those polls included Latino respondents. But polls on the opinions of Latinos as a group must have enough Latino respondents to be statistically valid, and most general polls do not meet this standard. However, PolitiFact found two major polling groups that focus on Latinos: Latino Decisions and the Pew Hispanic Center. In its 2011 National Survey of Latinos, the Pew Hispanic Center found that 91 percent favored the DREAM Act when asked this question: ""Thinking about immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children … would you favor or oppose a law that would let these young adults become legal residents if they go to college or serve in the military for two years?"" The most recent national poll from Latino Decisions, conducted in January 2012 with Univision News and ABC News, asked: ""Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?"" It found that 66 percent strongly supported the law and an additional 19 percent somewhat supported the law, for a total of 85 percent. In each poll, the margin of error was about 4 percentage points. When we asked the Texas Democratic Party for backup information, spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña also pointed us to a February 2011 national poll by Latino Decisions, with impreMedia, publisher of Spanish-language newspapers in Texas, California, New York and other states. Respondents were asked about the DREAM Act in a section of the survey that began: ""In December 2010, Congress considered a number of different policies. For each policy that I read, please tell me whether you approve or disapprove and how strongly."" The poll described the DREAM Act as providing ""undocumented immigrant children a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military."" The results: 67 percent of respondents said they strongly approved of the legislation and 18 percent said they somewhat approved, for a total — again — of 85 percent. (The margin of error was about 4 percentage points.) Our ruling Cruz said in an interview that he does not support the DREAM Act, and three polls over the past 13 months have shown at least 85 percent of Latinos favoring the legislation.

80,pomt-04082,"""Thanks to Washington, nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013. Somehow people think it's just the wealthy. It's not.""",half-true,/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/20/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-nearly-everyone-will-pay-mor/,"Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, frequently tweets on national political issues from @ScottKWalker. As the fiscal cliff deal approached, Walker pleaded with Washington not to ""screw up"" the economy by letting taxes go up. He then criticized the eventual deal in a series of tweets, culminating with this bipartisan slam on Jan. 4, 2013: ""Thanks to Washington, nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013. Somehow people think it’s just the wealthy. It’s not."" Walker poked at ""Washington"" again in his Jan. 15, 2013 ""state of the state"" speech, saying federal officials were putting more money in the hands of the government, not the people. Much of the fiscal-cliff debate, which ended in a New Year’s Day deal, focused on whether to extend the across-the-board reduction in federal income-tax rates approved in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. Those lower rates were due to expire at the end of 2012, but the cliff deal extended them. For almost everyone, that is. The deal locked in the reduced Bush-era rates for taxable income up to $400,000 (single filers) or $450,000 (joint). For the portion of a filer’s taxable income above those amounts, the tax rate will rise to 39.6 percent, the Clinton-era rate. Fewer than 1 percent of US households are expected to report taxable income above those thresholds in 2013, a Tax Policy Center study found. The deal kicks in a few other tax increases for wealthier folks, adding to some that were approved as part of federal health care reforms. But income-tax rates for most people will not change. So what does Walker mean when he says, ""nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013""? When we asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Nicole Tieman sent us a Wall Street Journal blog item on the deal’s failure to extend a different tax break -- the Social Security payroll tax holiday of 2011 and 2012. The holiday came from President Barack Obama as a continuation of Democratic-backed measures passed in the 2009 stimulus package. It reduced the worker share of Social Security taxes taken off paychecks from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. For example, that gave workers making $75,000 to $100,000 an average break of $1,194 on federal taxes in 2012, another Tax Policy Center study found. The average across all income levels was $721. In 2012, Obama initially sought to extend the payroll break again, but Republicans were split on it, and some Democrats weren’t thrilled with it either. So Obama and Congress let it die a quiet death. Three experts told us a large share of Americans will see their taxes rise in 2013 compared to 2012 because of the disappearance of the Social Security payroll tax holiday. Some 77 percent of all U.S. households will be paying more in taxes overall in 2013 than in 2012, almost completely because the payroll tax is returning to its old level, said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. William McBride, the chief economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, told us that ""anyone with a job that pays wages is affected, so, a high percentage of the population."" He said that 83 percent of tax returns report some wages. Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, confirmed it would hit ""every paycheck."" So, Walker is on to something regarding the payroll tax, though Williams said ""nearly everyone"" was a bit of a reach. There are a couple other important points to cover about Walker’s claim about the deal, formally known as The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Marr and Williams noted that Walker’s description is just one of the ways to look at the tax situation. ""Is it actually a tax increase, or are we just not giving you a break anymore?"" asked Williams. Unlike the Bush-era tax cuts, which Republican sponsors tried repeatedly to make permanent, the payroll tax was designed as short-term boost to the economy, Williams said. Marr called the Social Security tax holiday a political orphan, with neither party much interested in fighting over keeping it. If Washington had not acted on the payroll and income tax rates,90 percent of Americans would have seen a tax increase, Williams said. In blaming Washington for the tax increase, Walker takes into account the decision to end one break -- the Social Security payroll cut -- but does not factor in the new life that Congress and the president gave to another break, the income tax cuts that were extended for most. Our rating Walker tweeted, ""Thanks to Washington, nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013. Somehow people think it's just the wealthy. It's not."" From the perspective of the real net effect on people’s tax rates compared to last year in the wake of the deal, Walker’s claim about the fiscal-cliff legislation rings pretty true, depending on your definition of what constitutes ""nearly everyone."" The expiration of the Social Security payroll tax holiday means that tax will revert to higher, pre-2011 rates for everyone who earns a paycheck, though a minority of tax filers have no wage earnings. But he makes a glass-half-empty claim about a broad deal by viewing the result in a narrow context of one tax decision, while leaving out important information about the tax effect of another major decision that was part of the deal. It would also have the ring of truth to say that ""thanks to Washington"" a massive tax increase was averted in the same deal. But then, he only had 140 characters to work with.

We've won a greater share of the popular vote.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/10/barack-obama/a-slight-lead-in-popular-vote/,"After losing the Texas and Ohio primaries March 4, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama tried to downplay the losses by emphasizing that he leads Sen. Hillary Clinton in delegates and the popular vote. ""The bottom line is, we've won twice as many states. We've won a greater share of the popular vote,"" he said. The first part is easy to assess. At the point when he made this comment, Obama had won primaries or caucuses in 25 states (including the District of Columbia), while Clinton had won 14 states (not counting Florida and Michigan). Obama's math is off, but he's in the ballpark. Still, he would have been more accurate if he said he had won nearly twice as many states. The second part is a little trickier because some states that held caucuses — Iowa, Nevada, Washington and Maine — have not released popular vote totals. They've only released the percentage of the vote and the number of delegates won. Also, the election results from Florida and Michigan are in limbo because the Democratic National Committee has not recognized the results from those states because they defied the DNC schedule. It's further complicated by the fact that Obama was not on the ballot in Michigan. Adding up vote totals from the other contests, PolitiFact finds Obama to be ahead (as of March 7, 2008) by 13,002,527 to 12,413,052 if Michigan and Florida are not counted. He's also ahead by 13,578,741 to 13,284,038 if Florida is included but Michigan is not. The only scenario in which Clinton is ahead is if Michigan is also included. She has 13,612,347 to Obama's 13,578,741. We have to give thanks to RealClearPolitics.com, which tracks popular vote totals and provides links to results on state Web sites. We went to those individual sites and tallied the numbers on a spreadsheet. Keep in mind, some states are still adding up votes and these numbers will change. Also, we completed these calculations before the March 8, 2008, Wyoming caucus, so those results are not included. Back to Obama's claim: We find he has it mostly right. On the first part, he'd be better off hedging his claim on winning twice as many states as Clinton. But on the matter of popular vote, Obama is accurate. Though, to be fail-safe, he should have specified that he was excluding Michigan.

82,pomt-13924,"Austin was the ""site of the first mass shooting in the country.""",false,/texas/statements/2016/jun/23/steve-adler/steve-adler-wrong-first-us-mass-shooting-occurred-/,"Austin’s mayor struck a grim historical note when asked if he could help people understand the June 2016 shooting rampage that took 49 lives in a gay club in Orlando. ""For me it’s beyond understanding,"" Steve Adler replied on KOKE-FM’s morning program a couple of days after the carnage. ""It’s the kind of thing that could happen anywhere, though. You know,"" Adler said, ""Austin was ... the site of the first mass shooting in the country, from that tower, that was the very first one."" Adler was referring to the Aug. 1, 1966, acts of University of Texas student Charles Whitman, whose shots from atop UT’s iconic Main Building ultimately took 14 lives, wounding 31; he’d earlier stabbed to death his wife and mother. Whitman’s fusillade ended when he was shot and killed at short range. KOKE host Bob Cole followed up, asking Adler if he was saying Whitman represented ""the first mass shooting in our country."" ""That’s what I’m told,"" Adler replied. ""First one."" No doubt, Whitman holds broad significance. Texas author Gary Lavergne’s 1997 book, ""A Sniper in the Tower: The Charles Whitman Murders,"" says: ""With deadly efficiency, he introduced America to public mass murder, and in the process forever changed our notions of safety in open spaces."" Before 1966, Lavergne wrote, ""mass murder was so rare that the"" criminal justice ""system had no special category or documentation for it. Statistics and prosecutors had treated such criminals and their crimes in the same manner as a single murder."" However, mass shootings take in far more events than Adler acknowledged, making this Austin-was-first statement incorrect. Adler spokesman concedes error Mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford owned up to error when we inquired into the basis of Adler’s statement. By email, Stanford said he’d given the mayor the ""first mass shooting"" conclusion based on what he’d personally heard since moving to Austin in the 1990s. Next, we looked at news stories fetched from electronic archives, finding that the Austin American-Statesman didn’t deem Whitman the nation’s first mass shooter, at least in recent decades. Rather, a July 1991 American-Statesman news story called the day’s events ""one of the worst mass killings in American history."" Later in 1991, the Associated Press recapped the death of Richard Speck, who ""shocked the nation in 1966 by stabbing and strangling eight student nurses"" in a night. That story quoted James Alan Fox, then dean of Northeastern University’s College of Criminal Justice, saying the Speck slayings marked the start of America's ""age of mass murder. Mass murder was not something that was in our vocabulary until Richard Speck,"" Fox said. Whitman, the story noted, fired from the UT Tower two weeks after the Speck murders. Defining mass shootings That story's mention of Fox prompted us to seek the professor’s analysis of Adler’s statement. By phone, Fox reminded us that a mass shooting has conventionally been defined as one involving four or more deaths by gunfire, not counting military operations or shoot-outs connected to gang activity or other crimes, all in the same one-day period--a definition he sticks with, he said, for the sake of comparisons over time. That definition is in keeping with a 2008 FBI report stating that over the previous three decades, a mass murder was defined as four or more murders occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders--though later, a 2012 law set the federal threshold for a ""mass killing"" as three or more people killed, we noted in a January 2016 fact check. Yet there’s room for other definitions and a narrower term. By email, Fox noted a Stanford University database of U.S. mass shootings launched after the 2012 Sandy Hook shootings. The Stanford project advises: ""Instead of limiting our data collection to incidents in which four or more fatalities occurred (the previous FBI definition for mass murder), we instead collect incidents of three or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities). All mass shooting definitions are arbitrary in that there is no natural way to quantify such an event."" In June 2016, Stanford’s database, which chronologically starts with the Whitman shootings, listed more than 300 incidents fulfilling its ""mass shooting"" definition, most recently an April 2016 drive-by incident in Missouri that left four people injured. Mass public shootings To our inquiries, Fox and Grant Duwe, author of a book on mass murder in the U.S. and director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, each noted another term with a slightly different definition--""mass public shootings."" A 2013 Congressional Research Service report defined such shootings as ""incidents occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims somewhat indiscriminately."" Whitman, Fox suggested to us, accounted for the first mass public shooting on a college campus and the largest to that time. A memorable previous public mass shooting, Fox said, occurred in September 1949 when Howard Unruh shot and killed 13 people, including three children, in a 20-minute stroll through his neighborhood in Camden, N.J., according to Unruh’s October 2009 obituary in the New York Times. Duwe said in an October 2014 article in Reason that he’d identified 161 U.S. mass public shootings since 1900, ""which I've defined as incidents that occur in the absence of other criminal activity (e.g., robberies, drug deals, gang ‘turf wars,’ et cetera) in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period."" And from 1900 until Whitman acted, Duwe told us by phone, there were 30 U.S. public mass shootings. His break-out, provided by email, showed pre-Whitman mass public shootings in 20 states--all but two resulting in less than 10 deaths. ""Even though they didn’t match the number of victims killed or wounded in the UT-Austin shooting,"" Duwe said, ""they certainly qualify as mass public shootings."" According to the compilation, two pre-Whitman shooters caused more than a dozen deaths: Unruh and Frank Gonzalez, a California man who shot pilots on a passenger plane in May 1964; 43 people perished. A caution Generally, Fox and Duwe each cautioned against getting bogged down in assessments of first or worst mass shootings partly because, due to the limits of the commonly accepted definition, incidents such as the Saint Valentine’s Day and Wounded Knee massacres get parsed out. ""This whole thing of what’s the largest,"" Fox said, ""is really an absurd exercise as if any of these episodes would be any less tragic if wasn’t the largest."" Whitman, he added, ""certainly did for many many years embody what Americans thought of when they heard mass murder."" Our ruling Adler said Austin was the ""site of the first mass shooting in the country."" The UT tragedy appears to have been the nation’s first mass public shooting on a college campus. But there were 30 mass shootings--mass murders of four or more individuals in a 24-hour period--just in the 60-plus years before Whitman acted. We rate the statement False.

Romney supports the federal accountability law, and has for some time. Why? Because he has seen the effects of holding schools accountable through testing and standards in his own state. He refers specifically to his state's landmark 1993 Education Reform Act, which put such measures in place nine years before No Child took effect. Romney said the law has had a ""big impact."" And he's right. In 1998, just 7 percent of high school sophomores were scoring at the ""advanced"" level on the state's math exam. By 2007, 41 percent of sophomores could make that claim. Over the same period, the percentage of sophomores failing the English exam dropped from 28 percent to 6 percent, with corresponding increases in the top ratings. In 2005 and again in 2007, the state ranked first, or tied for first, in all four test categories for a widely respected exam commonly known as ""the nation's report card."" The categories are math and reading for fourth and eighth grade. No state had ever done that well across the board. ""In some respects, I would say you can track our success in Massachusetts to the fact that there was this issue of equity in education in the early 1990s,"" said Matt Militello, an assistant professor of educational policy at the University of Massachusetts. But the achievement gap persists. David Driscoll, the state's education commissioner in 2005, wrote that the state's performance gaps between white, black and Hispanic students remained unchanged since 2003. In 2007, the state's interim commissioner, Jeffrey Nellhaus, noted again that while the scores of white students were rising, those of black and Hispanic students were flat. Robert Costrell, Romney's former chief economist and education adviser, doesn't dispute the achievement gap. But he said that doesn't change the overall improvement. ""The gaps are still quite significant and of great concern. But there absolutely was a closing of those gaps,"" said Costrell, now a professor of education reform and economics at the University of Arkansas.

84,pomt-14641,"""Anyone can die of a toothache.""",true,/florida/statements/2016/jan/26/john-cortes/ignoring-toothache-really-could-potentially-kill-y/,"State Rep. John Cortes, D-Kissimmee, made a biting claim about the consequences of poor dental care during debate on a bill that would change the rules for Medicaid coverage. HB 819 is backed by MCNA, a Fort Lauderdale dental benefits company that lost its Medicaid contracts with the state after the 2011 switch to mandatory managed care. The bill allows the Legislature to take dental off the list of services that managed care plans are required to offer people on Medicaid. The state would then be able to contract with vendors like MCNA to provide the dental care instead. (Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry raised eyebrows for discussing the issue with Gov. Rick Scott on behalf of MCNA without first registering as a lobbyist.) Cortes, who voted for the bill, said he wanted to make sure proper dental care would be available for children, maintaining problems can easily arise without treatment. ""Anyone can die of a toothache,"" he said in a House Health Innovation Subcommittee meeting on Jan. 13, 2016. ""Believe it or not, you can."" The bill passed the committee by a 12-1 vote. Given this age of modern medicine, we wondered if Cortes was right. We decided to drill into this one to find out. The whole tooth We didn’t hear back from Cortes’ office, but unfortunately for all you odontophobes, you really should be getting checkups on a regular basis. ""Yes, it is possible to die from complications with an infected tooth,"" Thomas Porter, a faculty member at the University of Florida College of Dentistry, told PolitiFact Florida. ""Every year there are cases where the patient did not receive appropriate and timely treatment of an infected tooth. In most cases, the infected tooth starts as a localized site with pain and infection."" Obviously you’re not going to die of the physical pain, but these problems can start from some form of periodontal issue or, as is most often the case, cavities. The decay leads to abscesses, which are usually infections between the tooth and the gums. ""Not treated, the problem progresses and the patient becomes septic, which can lead to death,"" Porter said. Dr. Erin Sutton, a Fort Walton Beach dentist, pointed out the infection could either move to bone marrow or the bloodstream, causing sepsis and affecting major organs. This is not a new phenomenon, of course. Dental infections and other tooth-related problems were listed as the fifth- or sixth-leading cause of death in London back in the early 1600s. But it certainly happens today, too. The number of people who die from an untreated tooth problem is small, but the details can be harrowing. An oft-cited case is the 2007 death of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died when bacteria from an abscess infected his brain. He had two brain operations totaling $250,000 before he died, but he could have been saved with a timely tooth extraction that would have cost $80. His family had no health insurance and had lost Medicaid benefits. Kyle Willis, a 24-year-old unemployed father from Cincinnati, died in 2009 after being unable to afford a tooth extraction and prescription antibiotics for an infection. John Schneider of Mt. Orab, Ohio, was 31 when he died in 2014 after what he thought was a sinus infection but was actually an untreated abscess that eventually led to multiple organ failure. The scope of the danger was highlighted four years ago by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which found preventable dental conditions made up more than 830,000 emergency room visits in 2009. That was up 16 percent from 2006. While the number of deaths aren’t regularly examined, a 2013 study published in the Journal of Endodontics offered a quick cross-section of the issue based on one kind of condition. Researchers found that between 2000 and 2008, there were more than 61,000 hospitalizations nationally for periapical abscesses, an infection at the tip of a tooth’s root that is a common symptom of untreated tooth decay. Of those 61,000-plus stays, 66 patients died. Our ruling Cortes said, ""Anyone can die of a toothache."" It’s not so much that you’ll die of pain, of course, but dentists and research confirm that an untreated abscess can infect other parts of the body, either through the bones or the bloodstream. Most people won’t die from a toothache, but it’s a condition that if left untreated can lead to the worst: a fatal result.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., doesn’t like the Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, but he said he won’t work to overturn it if he becomes president. Instead, Rubio told NBC’s Chuck Todd, he would appoint Supreme Court justices who ""will interpret the Constitution as originally constructed."" Same-sex marriage is not a constitutionally protected right, and marriage laws have always been the responsibility of the states and not the federal government, Rubio said in an interview that aired Dec. 13 on Meet the Press. ""If you want to change the definition of marriage, then you need to go to state legislatures and get them to change it, because states have always defined marriage,"" he said. ""And that's why some people get married in Las Vegas by an Elvis impersonator. And in Florida, you have to wait a couple days when you get your permit. Every state has different marriage laws."" We wondered if Rubio was right that ""states have always defined marriage."" Rubio’s statement echoes critics of this summer’s Obergefell vs. Hodges Supreme Court ruling who say the specific issue of same-sex marriage should be left to individual states. Rubio has a point that marriage laws are largely the states' responsibility, such as the permit and license laws he noted. But states cannot make laws that violate the Constitution, and the June ruling legalizing same-sex marriage was not the first time the Supreme Court limited state regulation and, essentially, defined marriage. The most pertinent example is the 1967 Supreme Court decision in Loving vs. Virginia, which invalidated any bans on interracial marriages. The court decided unanimously that these bans violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. ""It is true that states have generally defined who can get married and the process by which it happens, unless those laws contradict the Constitution, as you rightly point out in the Loving case,"" said Jason Pierceson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield and author of Same-Sex Marriage in the United States: The Road to the Supreme Court. ""States have primary control in many policy areas, but those powers are limited by the 14th Amendment."" Jane Schacter, a Stanford University constitutional law professor, showed us a few more examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage laws on 14th Amendment grounds. In 1971’s Boddie vs. Connecticut, the court found a Connecticut law requiring poor people to pay a fee to get divorced violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Seven years later, in Zablocki vs. Redhail, the court overturned a Wisconsin statute barring fathers who were behind on child support payments from getting married. And in Turner vs. Safley, the court in 1987 said a Missouri statute barring inmates from getting married was unconstitutional. ""There is no unrestricted prerogative of a state to do whatever it wishes with respect to marriage, Constitution be damned,"" Schacter said. ""But it is always case by case."" Pierceson added that the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support, is another example of the federal government making a law affecting the definition of marriage. The law, which the court struck down in 2013, defined marriage as one man and one woman for federal purposes, such as tax provisions that take marital status into account. Marriage isn’t the only place where states make their own laws and then the Supreme Court can overturn them if they’re unconstitutional, said Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. For example, states run their own elementary education systems, but they cannot segregate their public schools because that would be unconstitutional. ""You can argue about whether (the same-sex marriage decision) has a firm basis in the Constitution,"" Roosevelt said. ""But it's not out of the ordinary just because it's a constitutional limit on state marriage laws."" Rubio’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Rubio said, ""States have always defined marriage."" Rubio has a point that states are generally in charge of administering marriage within their boundaries. However, his statement implies that state marriage regulations were untouched by the federal government up until the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and that is not the case. There are numerous 20th century examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage regulations that it found to be unconstitutional, including the 1967 decision to invalidate laws banning interracial marriages.

87,pomt-00380,"""We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California fire fighters.""",half-true,/punditfact/statements/2018/sep/07/fight-future/could-net-neutrality-have-shielded-california-fire/,"The idea that greedy corporations would screw over the average Internet user was perhaps the most vocal concern raised last year when a bundle of Internet protections, known as net neutrality, went on the chopping block. Now, three months after the regulations officially died, proponents are staking out a very different position as they work to resurrect the rules. Net neutrality must be restored, they argue, because its repeal has jeopardized public safety. ""We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California firefighters,"" said digital rights group Fight for the Future. Let’s unpack that statement, starting with the California fire. Using tech to fight fires Golden State firefighters are still working to contain the largest blaze in state history. The Mendocino Complex Fire began burning in Northern California in late July, and so far has torched over 726,000 acres — more than double the size of Los Angeles. Firefighters from around the state have been called to action. Among the out-of-town responders were firefighters from Santa Clara County, located in the center of Silicon Valley, about 160 miles south of the inferno. The Santa Clara County fire department deployed a high-tech truck, known in firefighter jargon as an ""Incident Support Unit,"" to serve as a command-and-control center. To work effectively, the trucks need a robust Internet signal. Its broadband hookup is used to power software like Google Sheets, which lets firefighters coordinate real-time responses. But in the midst of battling the largest fire in California history, the Santa Clara County truck’s Internet speed suddenly slowed to a crawl. At roughly 1/200 the original speed, firefighters would have been no worse off using a dial-up modem from the 1990s. So what the heck was happening? ""(We) discovered the data connection was being throttled by Verizon,"" Fire Chief Anthony Bowden said in a statement filed as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the FCC. ""These reduced speeds severely interfered with the unit’s ability to function effectively. ""Even small delays in response translate into devastating effects,"" he added, ""including loss of property, and, in some cases, loss of life."" The throttling persisted for some time even after the firefighters complained to Verizon and told the company of their urgent need to have fast Internet restored. Verizon later apologized for the incident. The restrictions were in place because the firefighters had a contract that said excess data usage was subject to significantly slowed-down speeds. But the company said it failed to comply with its own internal policy of taking its foot off the brake during emergencies. ""In supporting first responders in the Mendocino fire, we didn’t live up to our own promise of service and performance excellence when our process failed some first responders on the line, battling a massive California wildfire,"" Verizon said in a statement. ""For that, we are truly sorry."" The public relations fiasco drove Verizon to vow not to throttle west coast firefighters and some other first responders. But that olive branch had limited reach. For some, the incident was the most clear-cut demonstration of the shortcomings of industry self-policing in the post-net neutrality era. Instead of after-the-fact corporate damage control, they argue, what’s needed is to put the law back on the books. What is net neutrality anyways? So would Verizon’s conduct have been unlawful and punishable under net neutrality? That’s the main thrust of Fight for the Future’s statement. For the purposes of this fact-check, you need to bear in mind a couple of net neutrality’s key features. (See a more detailed explainer here.) A core idea behind net neutrality is that virtually all content will travel unimpeded around the same speed. ""Usually, when one thinks of a net neutrality violation, one thinks of the violation of the no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization rules,"" said Blair Levin, who served as chief of staff to the FCC chairman from 1993 through 1997. Of those three rules, we’re concerned here with only one: the ban on throttling. That rule generally prohibited Internet service providers, or ISPs, from slowing down customers’ speeds. However, to give ISPs flexibility in designing service plans that would avoid network congestion, the FCC carved out an exception. ISPs could offer plans that would allow willing customers to be throttled if they exceeded their data cap. In a sense, by signing this type of contract, customers waived their right not to be throttled. In addition to the no-throttling rule, you also need to know about net neutrality’s ""general conduct"" rule. That rule stopped companies like Verizon and Comcast from ""unreasonably interfering"" with customers’ Internet access. It also created an avenue for customers file complaints to the FCC, which could trigger an investigation into an ISP’s practices. One way to think about net neutrality with respect to ISPs is that it gave the FCC teeth. Net neutrality’s repeal, in turn, largely defanged it. So would the FCC have taken a bite out of Verizon if the old rules were still in play? The no-throttling rule The contract between Verizon and the California firefighters allowed throttling for excessive data use. In other words, the firefighters waived their right not to be throttled over their limit. Under the $37.99-per-month plan, the department would get high-speed broadband for the first 25 gigabytes. Data use beyond that was subject to speed reductions. The device installed in the California firefighter’s high-tech truck can use up to 5-10 gigabytes per day. At that rate, the firefighters quickly hit their cap. To some experts, the incident was simply the culmination of a series of mistakes — not a poster child for stronger regulation. ""What really happened wasn’t a net neutrality issue,"" Berin Szoka, a tech lawyer and president of the group TechFreedom, wrote. ""The (fire department) simply chose a data plan for their mobile command and control unit that was manifestly inappropriate for their needs."" What’s clear is that because the firefighters’ service plan permitted the kind of speed restrictions that were allowed under the old rules, Verizon did not directly violate net neutrality’s no-throttling rule. ""The throttling incident, while a real PR disaster for Verizon, has nothing to do with net neutrality,"" said Doug Brake, the director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. ""The rules explicitly allowed for data plans that rate-limit or ‘throttle’ a data connection after a certain threshold."" A spokeswoman for the Republican-majority FCC pointed out that the Santa Clara County fire department, which is party to a lawsuit against the FCC to restore net neutrality, does not argue the no-throttling rule was violated here. ""What happened had nothing to do with net neutrality,"" she said. ""Verizon was not discriminating on the basis of content, application, service or device."" Even the group behind the claim we’re checking, Fight for the Future, conceded the narrow point about the contract falling under the no-throttling exception. Evan Greer, Fight for the Future’s deputy director, told us, ""Verizon's throttling of firefighters was not a direct violation of the ‘no throttling’ rule since it related to a data cap."" The ‘general conduct’ rule But there’s another rule that could have ensnared Verizon: The ""general conduct"" rule. This prohibited companies like Verizon and Comcast from ""unreasonably interfering"" with customers’ Internet access. It also created an avenue for customers to file complaints to the FCC. But the repeal of net neutrality choked off this avenue. ""Under the 2015 rules, the firefighters could have filed a complaint with the FCC on grounds that the throttling was ‘unjust and unreasonable,’ "" said Chip Stewart, a communication technology expert and professor at Texas Christian University. ""After the current FCC repealed those rules, that is no longer an option."" Gigi Sohn, who was a counselor to the FCC chairman while the net neutrality rules were written, said she believes the firefighters ""could have made a persuasive case"" if that option were available today. ""The throttling of the Santa Clara County FPD’s broadband service was a disaster waiting to happen,"" Sohn wrote in an essay for NBC News. ""In the absence of net neutrality rules and without strong FCC oversight, broadband providers like Verizon, Comcast and AT&T are free to run their networks as they please without regard to consumers, competition or public safety."" Harold Feld, the senior vice president at the liberal Public Knowledge, said the key point comes down to whether or not there’s a process for aggrieved consumers to get a fair hearing. ""It’s not just about whether Verizon behaved appropriately or not,"" he told PolitiFact, citing a blog post he wrote. ""It’s about having clear rules and procedures in place so that when an emergency like this happens, people know what to do and can resolve the problem quickly."" Some tech experts say additional oversight is unnecessary because companies are capable of policing themselves. (Verizon has promised to do so with more verve in the future, for instance.) But not all agree. ""The removal of the 'cop on the beat' may have contributed to Verizon acting in ways that even it now admits was dumb,"" Levin said. ""If there is no one watching, people act differently than if they think someone is watching."" Our ruling Fight for the Future said, ""We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California fire fighters."" Under net neutrality, the firefighters could have filed a complaint against Verizon to the FCC, which at the very least would have launched an investigation, experts said. Repeal of the rules removed that avenue, thereby sidelining the FCC from serving as a ""cop on the beat."" However, the firefighters’ service plan permitted the kind of speed restrictions that were allowed under the old rules. So the company did not violate net neutrality’s no-throttling rule.

88,pomt-10040,"""When the salmonella source was finally identified, FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the [peanut] recall.""",true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/19/rosa-delauro/congresswoman-portrait-toothless-fda-accurate-thou/,"Is our food-safety system really that weak? We realized the recent outbreak of salmonella poisoning from peanut products exposed serious problems with food manufacturing and plant inspections. But Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, alleged it also exposed the federal Food and Drug Administration as toothless when it comes to recalls. ""When the salmonella source was finally identified, FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the recall,"" the congresswoman said at a Feb. 4, 2009, news conference. DeLauro was speaking amid great public concern about the outbreak, which was discovered in January 2009 after it killed eight people and sickened more than 500 in 43 states. It was traced to tainted peanut butter and paste from a Peanut Corporation of America plant in Georgia and possibly another in Texas. Those ingredients had been distributed nationwide in all sorts of products, prompting recalls of more than 2,100 products from energy bars to ice cream. DeLauro's comment evoked an image of FDA officials meekly asking company executives if it was okay to protect the public from tainted peanuts. We wondered whether she was stretching the truth to drum up support for a bill she proposed to strengthen the FDA's recall process. A spokeswoman said DeLauro was referring to the voluntary nature of food recalls. And indeed, the FDA recall process is almost entirely voluntary — strictly speaking. This is poorly understood by consumers, the media and even some food companies, the FDA says in this primer on its recall policies. ""The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not generally authorize FDA to 'order' a manufacturer to recall a food, cosmetic or supplement,"" the online brochure says. Only when it comes to medical devices, human-tissue products and infant formula can the agency order a recall. DeLauro's office said she got her information partly from this New York Times article , which reported that the government ""needed the company’s permission last week before announcing a huge recall of its products."" There's an important bit of context to add, though. In reality, companies do not generally refuse FDA requests to issue a recall. In fact, none has ever done so, at least in the memory of Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. ""I don't think there's ever been a case to my knowledge where a company has refused to recall products when we told them in very specific terms that we would be taking additional actions,"" Sundlof told a Senate committee in a Feb. 5, 2009, hearing on the salmonella outbreak. Additional actions the FDA can take against any company that refuses to recall food can include seizing products and enjoining the company from doing further business. Bill Marler, a personal injury lawyer who specializes in foodborne illnesses, concurred with Sundlof. He said companies have little motivation to refuse the agency's recall requests, or even delay the process, because doing so would expose them to more legal liability. ""In my experience, there is very seldom a delay, because most of the time you've got a company who wants to solve the problem and not poison any more of its customers than it already has,"" said Marler, who is based in Seattle. Plenty of food-safety advocates argue the FDA should have the authority to mandate recalls. But their main concern is not that companies refuse to issue recalls voluntarily, it's issues such as FDA's limited control over how aggressively to recover products, and that ""voluntary recalls"" might not sound serious enough to consumers. DeLauro arguably made our food-safety regime sound weaker than it is, since there is little question as a practical matter that companies will quickly agree to recalls. And it was imprecise for her to say the FDA waited for the company's approval to ""go live"" with the recall — the FDA did not ""go live"" with the recall at all; it was the company that issued it. But ""go live"" is a vague term, and DeLauro seems to have meant ""announce."" And it's true that the FDA could not post on its Web site this press release announcing the recall, which came from the Peanut Corporation of America, until the company agreed to issue the recall and wrote the release. So while DeLauro's depiction of the recall process was not full and complete, it was technically accurate.

89,pomt-04497,"Says ""Portland has higher standards than feds on allowed police use of force.""",true,/oregon/statements/2012/oct/05/sam-adams/are-portlands-use-force-standards-stricter-federal/,"The Portland City Council's decision to fight the mandated rehiring of Portland police officer Ron Frashour -- the man responsible for the 2010 fatal shooting of Aaron Campbell -- has again stoked public discussion about use of force. Central to the Frashour case is the question of whether the officer used the proper level of force in his interactions with Campbell two years ago. Frashour was initially fired after shooting an unarmed Campbell in the back, though a Multnomah County grand jury had found no criminal wrongdoing. The case then went to an arbitrator who heard training officers testify that Frashour acted as trained. The city is fighting that determination and the controversy over the policy and Frashour’s actions has stayed hot. In a small Twitter dust up, one user (@nextchampjr) asked Mayor Sam Adams if he thought the federal standard for use of force, which the arbiter found Frashour met, ought to be reworked. The mayor replied that, in fact, ""Portland has higher standards than feds on allowed police use of force."" We wondered whether that was accurate. Before we get to our analysis, we note that we’re staying out of the debate over how Frashour was trained, and how well. We are only examining the policy. First, we needed to establish the generally accepted federal standard. Such a standard exists, but not in quite the way you might expect. There’s no series of agreed-upon federal guidelines that lay out exactly what sort of force can be used in a specific instance. Instead there’s a legal term called the Graham Standard or the Objective Reasonableness Standard. Back in 1989, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Graham v. Connor that any questions regarding the use of force should be held to the Fourth Amendment rules of ""reasonableness."" Essentially, this means that any use of force should be such that it would be deemed necessary by ""a reasonable officer."" ""When we say reasonable, it's an objective standard,"" explains Tung Yin, a criminal law professor at Lewis and Clark. ""You judge it from the perspective of the reasonable officer on the scene."" This caused some controversy at the time the case was decided because whether you perceive force as reasonable in the heat of the moment -- which is the standard -- is often different than how you perceive it after the fact, Yin said. So, how is Portland’s policy different? Caryn Brooks, the mayor's spokeswoman, pointed us to Portland Police Policy 1010.20. According to that policy, adopted by former Police Chief Rosie Sizer, officers should use ""only the force reasonably necessary under the totality of circumstances to perform their duties and resolve confrontations effectively and safely."" That piece just gets the bureau in line with the legal standards. But the policy also adds these two pieces of direction: 1) ""It is the policy of the Bureau to accomplish its mission as effectively as possible with as little reliance on force as practical."" 2) ""The Bureau expects members to develop and display, over the course of their practice of law enforcement, the skills and abilities that allow them to regularly resolve confrontations without resorting to the higher levels of allowable force."" Yin described this text as more ""aspirational text, rather than any sort of legal requirement"" but said he felt the mayor’s characterization was accurate. We agree with Yin.

""These 60 acres have produced zero SPLOST money for parks and recreation, have produced zero money for education,"" said John Loud, who owns Loud Security, based in Cobb. True? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d do some digging. Loud, along with Superior Plumbing owner Jay Cunningham, have spearheaded an effort to rally public support in favor of the plan. The two men led a campaign for a 1 percent sales tax for education in Cobb County and the Marietta city school system that passed in March. Loud said he was referring to sales tax money from the land that has gone back to the county government or school system. ""There’s no sales tax that comes out of those acres,"" he said. The Braves have secured land within the Cumberland Community Improvement District, team officials say. The team plans to use 60 acres for the stadium and development, the Braves say. The Cumberland CID is an area approved to tax businesses within its borders. The land is located just north and west of I-75 and I-285. The team wants to build a 41,500-seat stadium, along with an amphitheater, stores and restaurants leading up to the ballpark. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has identified several parcels where it believes the Braves want to build the new stadium and other development. The Braves declined to identify the parcels that have been secured, citing a confidentiality agreement. The team did say it believes the land is undeveloped. A Cobb County government spokesman agreed. ""It’s all vacant land,"" said the spokesman, Robert Quigley. Cobb, like most metro Atlanta counties, collects a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax on most items sold in local businesses to pay for the construction of new government buildings, roadways and equipment. Quigley said the county cannot collect SPLOST proceeds from vacant property. As for whether the property has produced zero money for education, that’s a more complicated element to Loud’s claim. Cobb collects about $140,000 a year in school taxes from the land, Quigley said. Our total, based on the parcels the AJC believes the Braves have secured, was close, at nearly $143,000. Loud was aware of how much money is collected in property taxes for the school system when PolitiFact Georgia gave him a call. He stressed he was talking about sales tax revenue in The Marietta Daily Journal article. ""There’s no commerce (there), so there’s no sales tax generated,"" said Loud, who believes the county will collect millions of dollars annually from the land if it is developed by the Braves. To sum up, Loud said the 60 acres the Atlanta Braves are considering as part of a stadium development have produced no SPLOST money for parks and recreation and zero money for education. The site’s owners currently pay property taxes that go to the county’s school system. Loud said he was referring to sales tax revenue from the land. His quote in the newspaper article could had been clearer about the point he was trying to make. There is some additional detail that must be understood for anyone who reads Loud’s quote.

Too often, Trump said, successful people don't run for president because they don't want to be ""scrutinized or abused."" As a result, he said, we get presidents like Barack Obama. ""Our current president came out of nowhere. Came out of nowhere,"" Trump said. ""In fact, I'll go a step further: the people that went to school with him, they never saw him, they don't know who he is. It's crazy."" The line drew big applause from the conservative audience. We tried unsuccessfully to reach Trump to see if he was suggesting that Obama led an unremarkable life during his school years, or if it was a wink to the conservative legions who are not convinced that Obama is a natural-born American citizen. In any case, Trump's comment harkens back to an attack line that dogged Obama throughout the 2008 presidential campaign -- that he had a shady background that didn't add up. First, we'll set the stage with a brief outline of Obama's academic career. Obama began his schooling in Indonesia (where his mother and step-father had moved from Hawaii), attending Besuki Public School and St. Francis of Assisi School, both in Jakarta, from ages 6 to 10. Obama then returned to Honolulu, Hawaii, to live with his maternal grandparents and attended Punahou School, a private college preparatory school, through high school. Obama began his college career at Occidental College in California in 1979. After two years, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he studied political science and graduated with a B.A. in 1983. Obama later went to, and graduated from, Harvard Law School. We'll start in the middle of Obama's post-secondary education, his two years at Columbia, because that has been the nexus of previous ""None-of-his-classmates-knew-him"" claims. As Snopes.com points out in an October 2009 article debunking the claim, it appears to have roots in two sources. The first is a 2008 Wall Street Journal editorial about ""Obama's Lost Years"" at Columbia which states, ""Fox News contacted some 400 of his classmates and found no one who remembered him."" About the same time, Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee Wayne Allen Root -- who attended Columbia at the same time as Barack Obama -- told Reason: ""I think the most dangerous thing you should know about Barack Obama is that I don't know a single person at Columbia that knows him, and they all know me. I don't have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia. Ever!"" In a 2005 interview in an alumni magazine, Columbia College Today, Obama said that while at Columbia he was somewhat involved with the Black Students Organization and participated in anti-apartheid activities, but otherwise kept a fairly low profile. ""Mostly, my years at Columbia were an intense period of study,"" said Obama, who lived off campus. ""When I transferred, I decided to buckle down and get serious. I spent a lot of time in the library. I didn’t socialize that much. I was like a monk."" So he wasn't BMOC. But he wasn't entirely invisible either. A May 15, 2008, story by the Associated Press, ""Old friends recall Obama's years in LA, NY,"" quotes the recollections of an old roommate of Obama's in New York, Sohale Siddiqi. And former roommate and friend, Phil Boerner, has shared his recollections of Obama's time at Columbia with several reporters and is quoted in David Remnick's Obama's biography, The Bridge. The New York Times did an extensive interview with Boerner for a Jan. 20, 2009, story. And Politico posted online an article Obama wrote for Columbia's weekly magazine, The Sundial, which ran under the headline, ""Breaking the War Mentality"" on March 10, 1983. After FactCheck.org ran a story about the Columbia classmate's claim, another former classmate e-mailed to say she, too, remembered Obama. So we called her. Cathie Currie, who currently teaches social psychology at Adelphi University, recalled Obama joining her group occasionally to play pick-up soccer games on the lawn outside the library. She was a graduate student at the time, and Obama was an undergrad. He was a good soccer player, she said, even though basketball was his primary athletic passion. Obama also made an impression with his maturity and wisdom, she said. He talked about things like government for all the people, she said. In fact, Currie assumed because of Obama's heady conversation that he was a graduate student as well. Currie isn't surprised that he was not widely-remembered by fellow Columbia classmates. ""My sense of it was that he was keeping a low profile,"" Currie said. He seemed like someone who had made a decision to prioritize his studies, she said. ""We'd ask him to go out with us for beers after soccer,"" she said. ""He seemed like he wanted to, but then he'd step back and say, 'Sorry, I'm going to the library.'"" We're not going to spend too much time on Obama's time at Occidental and Harvard Law. Dozens of former classmates and teachers from those schools have publicly shared their recollections (and photos) of Obama. Obama was the president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review journal, for goodness sake. But here's a few stories chock full of classmates' recollections: New York Times, ""In Law School, Obama Found Political Voice."" Boston Globe, ""At Harvard Law, a unifying voice: Classmates recall Obama as even-handed leader."" The Weekly Standard, ""The Real Obama."" For this story, reporter Dean Barnett contacted dozens of Obama's classmates at Harvard Law School. ""Also noteworthy is that virtually everyone seemed to know Obama,"" Bartnett wrote. YouTube.com even has this video of classmate Hill Harper talking about Obama. In fact, many of Obama's former classmates volunteered for his presidential campaign, and Politico ran a story about some 20 Harvard classmates who were members of his transition team. The story ran under the headline ""School buds: 20 Harvard classmates advising Obama."" As for Occidental, lots of former classmates and teachers have come forward to talk about the Obama they remember from his two years on campus there. For example, see the Los Angeles Times' Jan. 29, 2007, story, ""Occidental recalls 'Barry' Obama."" Trump casts a wide net with the statement ""people that went to school with him."" So we did a little digging to see whether there have been any classmates from elementary and high school who recall Obama. Plenty. A comprehensive story on Obama's childhood by the Chicago Tribune should put this to rest. By our count, it names -- and quotes -- more than a dozen former classmates and teachers from Obama's youth. Among those quoted are two students from each of the two schools Obama attended in Indonesia, as well as several of Obama's grade school teachers. They related stories of how Obama was teased because of his race, how he struggled with learning the Indonesian language, how he drew cartoons and even wrote an essay about how he wanted to be president one day. The story also quotes several classmates and teachers at Punahou School in Hawaii, a private school Obama attended in Hawaii through high school. Among them are some of Obama's closest childhood friends, as well as teachers. In his senior year, Obama's basketball team (he was not a starter) won a state championship in 1979. The Chicago Tribune notes that Obama was nicknamed ""Barry O'Bomber"" by teammates due to his accuracy on long jump shots. David Remnick's Obama biography The Bridge is sprinkled with quotes from former classmates and teachers of Obama in elementary and high school. We could get deeper into this but it seems like overkill. It's abundantly clear that there are lots and lots of former classmates who remember Obama at every level of school. It's true that Obama's two years at Columbia are relatively undocumented. And far fewer classmates have publicly shared recollections of Obama from that period, as opposed to other school years before and after. At Columbia, Obama was a transfer student, he lived off campus and by his and other accounts he buried himself in his studies and didn't socialize much. But even so, there are several students who recall Obama at Columbia. In short, media accounts and biographies are filled with on-the-record, named classmates who remember Obama. Trump is certainly right that presidential candidates are heavily scrutinized. As even a basic online search confirms, Obama's school years were, too. Trump's claim that people who went to school with Obama ""never saw him, they don't know who he is"" is ridiculous. Or, to borrow Trump's phrase, it's crazy.

And they’ve been known to pop up on the red carpet. Then there is their place in Colorado. …. And court documents say Connie spent little time in the modest Florida condo. Even his ex-wife testified it was only purchased just to assist his political career. But Connie says his real home is in Florida. Do you believe him? …. Florida needs a full-time senator instead of a Half-Mack here half the time."" The narrator calls for Mack to release his travel records to determine if he is really ""California Connie, Colorado Connie or just modest Condo Connie."" (There are two photos in the ad that viewers might assume are Mack at a ski resort or the inside of his Fort Myers condo. But a LeMieux campaign spokeswoman said they are stock art.) Mack’s campaign fought back saying that LeMieux was avoiding the issues. We can’t independently verify what percentage of Mack’s time is spent at his Florida condo. But we can put one LeMieux claim to the Truth-O-Meter: is Mack a resident of California living with his wife in Palm Springs? Residency rule It’s not uncommon for members of Congress to own or rent a residence in the Washington area. But the questions about Mack are a little different because he’s married to a member of Congress representing another state. Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004; he filed for divorce from his wife Ann in 2005. About two years later, Mack married U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., the widow of singer and Congressman Sonny Bono. After he announced his U.S. Senate bid in 2011, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that Mack had been ""criticized for not spending enough time in Florida due to his wife. … Mack said he and his wife spend time together in Washington and then usually go separate ways on the weekend — the opposite situation from other lawmakers. Another incentive to be in Florida, he said: an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son from his first marriage are in the state."" LeMieux’s online video doesn’t suggest that Mack is violating the law, but it tries to create the perception that he isn’t spending much time in Florida. The U.S. Constitution requires Senate candidates to be a citizen of the U.S. for at least nine years and a resident of the state when elected. Florida’s election code doesn’t define residency, according to a 1993 advisory opinion by the state Division of Elections. Florida courts ""have consistently construed legal residence to mean a permanent residence, domicile, or permanent abode, rather than a residence that is temporary,"" states the opinion. (The state elections’ division told us the opinion is still valid even though it is nearly 20 years old.) Experts on election requirements told us that there is no ""bright line"" test to determine residency. ""The idea is that you are supposed to be related in a meaningful way to the state you represent, and you don’t just show up to run for office,"" said Frances Hill, who teaches election law at the University of Miami. Mack addresses residency question During a stop in Tallahassee on May 4, 2012, PolitiFact Florida asked Mack about his living situation. ""The question they (opponents) try to get to is, am I spending all of my time in California? And it's just not true. As many times as I've answered that ... last year I think I spent maybe 11 days in California,"" he said. ""What I'm saying is this, it's political fodder that my opponents like to spin. But to give you an example ... Monday I was in Miami. Tuesday morning in Miami, Tuesday afternoon in Fort Myers, Tuesday evening here in Tallahassee, then we went to Panama City, Pensacola, back here in Tallahassee, then we're going to go to Jacksonville, then we're going to Fort Lauderdale, then we go to Fort Myers, then we go to Orlando, then I go back to DC for votes."" The example he gave is expected of a campaign, PolitiFact Florida noted. We asked him to elaborate on how he divides his time on a day-to-day basis. ""I just gave you every day. This is my home, this is where I live, and this is a cheap political shot by my opponents that other than the press and my opponent, no one asks. It's not on their mind. They're not concerned about it. They know that this is where I am."" Homes owned by Mack or his wife Here’s what we found when we looked for homes owned by Mack (whose legal name is Cornelius McGillicuddy IV) or his current wife Mary Bono Mack: Fort Myers: Mack owns a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo at 15081 Tamarind Cay Court in Fort Myers, Lee County property records show. Mack and his first wife, Ann, bought the condo for $166,900 in October 2003. After her husband filed for divorce in 2005, Ann stated in a September 2005 divorce court filing that Mack bought it to ""solely to assist his political career"" when he was running in the congressional district for the area. The Mack campaign disputes Ann’s account. After he won the election in 2004, the family moved to a 5-bedroom home in Alexandria, Va. Ann wrote that they spent very little time in the ""modest"" condo in Fort Myers. She argued during the divorce proceedings that he forced her and their two children to live in the ""small political stake in the sand"" in Fort Myers while he stayed in the home in Virginia. Mack later sold the Virginia home. Mack has a homestead exemption on his Fort Myers condo. The Tampa Tribune raised questions about Mack’s exemption because his current wife has an exemption on her California home. Under Florida state law, Mack is entitled to the exemption if he can prove his finances aren’t co-mingled with those of his wife. Mack campaign spokesman David James told the Miami Herald in February that Mack meets that criteria: ""They file separate returns, do not have joint accounts, and Connie’s name is not on Mary’s home in California, and Mary’s is not on Connie’s home in Fort Myers,"" James said. (James also sent us similar statements from Mack’s attorney,Craig Engle.) Lee County Property Appraiser Ken Wilkinson said in February that he would research the legality of Mack’s homestead but told the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times: ""I think they’ll be okay. That’s my gut feeling,"" Wilkinson said. ""But I now have an obligation to check this out."" Mack has until around mid September to submit evidence showing that their finances are separate. The homestead controversy surfaced after Mack criticized Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for getting an agricultural exemption on a Brevard County property. Palm Springs, Calif.: Mary Bono purchased an $875,000 three-bedroom home at 64505 Via Amante in Palm Springs in 1998. The home is 5,450 square feet and worth about $1.1 million, Riverside County records show. Durango, Colo.: Mack’s 2011 financial disclosure states that he has a mortgage on a rental property in Durango, Colo., between $250,001 and $500,000 from October 2010. He also wrote that he was 16.67 percent owner in the property, which is owned by the company Mack and his wife formed, Westerfield Scotch LLC. La Plata, County records show that the two-bedroom two-bath unit is nearly 2,000-square feet and that they purchased the condo for $692,500 in October 2010. A warranty deed from October states that Mack and Bono Mack ""whose legal address is 64505 Via Amante, Palm Springs...."" A November 2010 warranty deed signed by Mack and Bono Mack states that ""Connie Mack and Mary Bono Mack of the county of Riverside, state of California, and Westerfield Scotch, a Colorado limited liability company, whose legal address is 64505 Via Amante, Palm Springs..."" The couple occasionally stays there for vacations and rent it out to others, Bono Mack’s spokesman Ken Johnson said. Her adult children are also owners. Mack’s attorney Craig Engle told PolitiFact the ""document is mistaken"" when it states that Mack’s legal address is in Palm Springs and that it would be wrong to interpret that document to mean that Mack is a California resident. Engle stated that the documents had to list an address for mailing purposes, and that could be why it has Bono Mack’s Palm Springs address. Arlington, Va.: Mary Bono purchased a two-bedroom condo at 3600 S. Glebe Road at the Eclipse at Center Park in Arlington, Va., for $549,313 in March 2007. She married Mack later that year. Connie Mack’s name doesn’t appear on that record, and a court land records clerk told us only Bono’s name is on the deed. The congresswoman had the condo under construction contract starting in 2005, her spokesman said. (The Web ad doesn’t mention this condo.) Conclusion LeMieux’s web ad states ""Sources show Mack as a resident of California, living with his wife in Palm Springs."" It’s legitimate to raise the question of how much time Mack spends in various places. And we can’t independently verify how much time he spends in California compared to his Fort Myers condo or anywhere else. But in this case, the ad’s ""sources"" are deeds for a Colorado condo owned by Mack and his wife that list their legal address as the Palm Springs home. While it’s unusual to have a spouse who lives in another state, both Mack and his wife work in Washington. They also owned their own homes and had professional careers in their respective states before they married. Given that context, we don’t think the deed to a vacation home in Colorado is definitive proof that Mack is living in California. One of our principles at PolitiFact is that campaigns have the burden to offer proof for what they say. In this case, the LeMieux campaign doesn’t have much.

Barack Obama speaks directly to the camera about his life story and his legislative accomplishments. ""America is a country of strong families and strong values,"" the ad begins. ""My life's been blessed by both. I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up."" Later in the ad, Obama says, ""I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected."" For his statement that he ""extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected,"" the campaign points to a couple of pieces of legislation. In 2008, Obama and Sen. Claire McCaskill contributed key portions to the National Defense Authorization Act that required postdeployment mental health screenings and a national study on the needs of Iraq veterans. We looked into the legislative history of the bill and found that Obama and McCaskill can at least take some credit for developing the list of requirements. It's not a major extension of benefits, however. Another problem for Obama is that he missed the final vote on the bill because he was campaigning. Republican nominee John McCain missed it, too. The bill passed overwhelmingly, 91-3. The other piece of legislation the campaign points to is an amendment Obama passed that picked up the tab for meals and phone calls for Iraq veterans receiving outpatient treatment. We looked at this legislation previously when Obama talked about it at a debate in Las Vegas in early 2008. Obama closed a loophole for outpatient veterans; hospitalized veterans were already covered. So in fairness, this was a tweak to previous legislation. If Obama had said he had helped extend health care for wounded veterans who'd been neglected, we would have given him a better rating. But he phrased his accomplishment to take more of the credit than that. Missing the vote on the 2008 bill does not help his case.

94,pomt-13538,"""None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question. ... If we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/29/gary-johnson/johnson-questions-pollsters-he-tries-join-clinton-/,"The only poll that matters, dealers in political cliches tell us, is the one taken on Election Day. For third party candidates, the Committee on Presidential Debates has imposed another consequential metric: they must reach 15 percent in a select set of polls if they want access to the debates and the attention and credibility that are attached. Right now, it looks like Clinton and Trump will be alone on stage come debate season. But if the polls were just conducted differently, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has suggested he would easily meet that requirement. ""None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question, ‘Well, what if you add Johnson-Weld?’,"" Johnson told CNBC on August 22. In a couple of other cases Johnson specified how well he thinks he’d be doing if he were listed as an option in pollsters’ first horse-race question: 20 percent, more than enough to qualify for the debates. ""I think if we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent. A lot of that has to do with how polarizing the two of them are. But that's the issue right now. We need to be top line on the polls,"" Johnson said in another CNBC interview on Aug. 11. This would be quite a swing. Theodore Roosevelt was the last third-party presidential candidate to register more than 20 percent of the vote on Election Day, running as a Bull Moose in 1912, and Ross Perot reached 18.9 percent in 1992. We decided to look at whether the polls are really being conducted the way Johnson says, and if it really has such a dramatic impact. We looked at 25 national polls conducted in July and August, chosen off of a list compiled by FiveThiryEight.com. Based on this list, we can say that Johnson is certainly wrong that every poll asks about Clinton and Trump before adding his name in a later question. Eleven of the polls we looked at -- close to half -- included Johnson in their first or only question about the presidential horse-race. None of these polls vaulted Gary Johnson to 20 percent. In fact, he did slightly worse, on average, when he was included in the first horse-race question. Johnson’s average in the 25 polls was 9 percent. When he was listed in a later horse-race question, his average performance was slightly higher than that average. In the polls where he was listed in the first or only horse-race question, Johnson did slightly worse on average. Some of his best performances -- 12 percent in polls conducted for Fox News and International Business Daily and 13 percent in a poll conducted for CNN -- were in polls that listed him in a later question. We ran Johnson’s theory by several academics who study polling. While research hasn’t been done on the specific question Johnson addresses, they told us that question order could have an effect on polling results. All of them were, however, skeptical that the effect could be as large as Johnson suggested. ""It's not a totally crazy notion to think that including him in the first round versus not might affect his support. As a researcher, I would ask how big an effect that would have to be to get the kind of outcome he said. … You would have to have an effect of about 12 percent shift, which to me is just implausible,"" Adam Berinsky, a professor of political science at MIT. Even if there was some sort of bias introduced by the question order, it wouldn’t necessarily be in his favor. ""(Trump and Clinton) have the lowest favorability ratings of presidential candidates in recent memory. So I could spin a story that would suggest if you first ask about Clinton or Trump without Johnson, you kind of prime people to think ‘I don’t really like either of these folks.’ And then you include the question with him in it, and they say, ‘Oh, there’s another option,"" Berinsky said. When reached for comment about this article, Johnson communications director Joe Hunter wrote in an email that, ""As far as the issue of whether a third candidate is included in the first ballot test question, or added to a subsequent question, we believe it does, indeed, make a difference, and pollsters with whom we work agree."" Since Johnson’s likely to appear on the ballot in all 50 states, it's worth considering why any pollster puts forward a horse-race question without including his name. Support for third party candidates tends to flag down the stretch, with many of their supporters leaving for one of the major party options. Questions that only offer those candidates allow pollsters to get a sense of how people currently registering support for third parties might break if that happens. It's worth noting that Johnson seems to be bucking this trend, according to a recent article by the polling analysts at 538. Based on current polling, 538’s polls-plus general election forecast, which adjusts for economic factors and historical trends, expects Johnson to earn a bigger percentage of the vote than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992. Our ruling Johnson said that polls ask about a straight Clinton/Trump race first, cueing them to ignore his name when it appears later. He said that including his name in the first questions pollsters asked about the horse-race could increase his support to 20 percent. Many polls do include Johnson’s name in their first horse-race poll, and Johnson does not do better in these polls. Experts say the jump Johnson is talking about is implausible.

He’s been getting pretty specific about some of his ideas, both in an op-ed in USA Today and in speeches on the campaign trail. His plans include ending subsidies for Amtrak, stopping funding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and eliminating foreign aid to countries ""that oppose America’s interests."" He also wants to save money by rolling back President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. He made the point in the USA Today op-ed, suggesting he would ""repeal ObamaCare, which would save $95 billion in 2016."" We were surprised by his suggestion. As we remembered the health care negotiations, Democrats took pains to make sure the 2010 health care law was projected to reduce the deficit, and they bragged repeatedly about their numbers. We contacted the Romney campaign, which referred us to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the agency that independently calculates the cost of laws proposed by both parties. In February 2011, the CBO published an analysis of a Republican measure to fully repeal the health care law. The analysis was for H.R. 2, ""the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act,"" a simple repeal bill that House Republicans approved on Jan. 19, 2011. Keep in mind, though, that repealing the health care law doesn’t only cut spending. The law had many moving parts, some of which were revenue sources to offset the spending and reduce the overall federal deficit. The law spent money on providing tax subsidies to help people buy insurance and by expanding the Medicaid health insurance for the very poor. But it offset those additional costs by slowing the growth of future spending on Medicare, the health insurance program for Americans over age 65. And, it generated revenues for the government by creating new excise taxes on high-cost health insurance plans (the ""Cadillac"" plans); adding new Medicare taxes on people with high incomes; and charging new fees to health insurance companies and health care manufacturers. In other words, if you fully repeal the law, you would also be repealing things that reduce the deficit, such as cost reductions and higher taxes. Romney cited a reduction of $95 billion in 2016, but that number only counts what the law spends that year. Most of the spending is for subsidizing coverage for the uninsured. That same year, the law also is projected to raise revenues of $78 billion, largely through new taxes on the wealthy and new fees on the health care industry. So according to the CBO analysis, a full repeal of the bill would reduce the deficit by $16 billion in 2016, much less than the number Romney cited. And then there’s the broader picture: When the CBO looked at the first 10 years of repeal, from 2012 to 2021, it found that repeal added $210 billion to the deficit. So the deficit would actually be lower if the law is not repealed. Finally, we should note that a repeal of the law would not necessarily be ""easy. ""Romney would need to have solid Republican majorities in Congress, including 60 members in the Senate to block filibusters. If Romney had only criticized the law as an expansion of government spending, he would have been on firmer ground. Instead, he asserted that a repeal of the law would save significant money -- $95 billion. In fact, the law included new taxes and cost reductions so that the actual savings for the year he cited would be much smaller -- $16 billion. And, over the long haul, repealing the law actually adds significantly to the deficit. So we rate his statement False.",None,Mitt Romney,None,None,None,2011-11-04T17:47:44,2011-11-04,['None']
96,pomt-12879,"Imitation dairy products often differ nutritionally from those they mimic, and labeling them ""milk"" or ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" is ""against the law.""",mostly true,/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/27/tammy-baldwin/labeling-imitation-dairy-products-milk-or-cheese-o/,"Hostilities between the dairy industry and its competitors are flaring anew as alternatives to cow’s milk take up more space in the dairy case. That means the politicians can’t be far behind. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, spoke up Jan. 12, 2017 in a news release lauding herself as somebody who ""stands up for Wisconsin dairy farmers."" Baldwin wants Congress to pass the Dairy PRIDE Act -- officially known (at least to a few) as the ""Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act."" After two years of falling milk prices, she and other federal lawmakers want the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to enforce consumer regulations defining ""milk."" Is Baldwin right that imitation dairy products -- for instance, soy milk -- often differ nutritionally from dairy item? And is labeling them ""milk"" or ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" against the law? To back that up, Baldwin’s office pointed us to nutritional labels, and to FDA regulations that plainly state: ""Milk is the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows."" 'Against the law' To dairy officials, inclusion of the word ""milk"" on non-dairy products is a misappropriation of the popularity of cow’s milk. But competitors say coconut milk and soy milk have long histories and aren’t confused with dairy. What’s more, they note, the FDA doesn’t punish ""peanut butter"" for using the dairy term ""butter."" But the FDA in 2008 and 2012 did tell two makers of drinks labeled ""soy milk"" that under its regulations, such labeling was inappropriate because the products did not contain ""milk"" as defined by the agency. ""Soy drink"" or ""Soy beverage"" would be better, the agency said at the time. That -- and regulatory language allowing the FDA to declare a product misbranded and try to block its sale -- help Baldwin’s case. Federal regulations are part of the United States Code that is the law of the land. But to the frustration of the dairy industry, the agency has not consistently enforced that line of reasoning, allowing use of ""soy milk"" and ""almond milk"" and many others. Rebecca Cross, a San Francisco-based regulatory lawyer for food product companies, said the FDA may be viewing labels on a case-by-case basis and allowing use of dairy terms on plant-based products so long as the use is not misleading. Nathan Beaver, a food and drug lawyer with Foley & Lardner in Washington, D.C., explained that foods such as soy milk that have no FDA-written ""standard of identity"" must choose a ""common or usual"" name for their products. Courts, though, have jurisdiction over disputes on the issue and therefore get final say on the meaning of the FDA rules. On milk, courts so far have found that cow’s milk competitors are not misbranded if their names don’t confuse consumers, said Cross. The nutrition comparison Dairy alternatives, Baldwin said, ""contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products."" This is a bit tricky to evaluate given that beverages labeled as some kind of ""milk"" now come from such diverse sources as soy, almonds, cashews, hemp, rice, oats, coconut and sunflowers. For help, we turned to Vandana Sheth, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a leading organization of food and nutrition professionals. For starters, Sheth noted that dairy products can be a good source of calcium, vitamin D, protein and other essential nutrients. Soy milk provides close to the same amount of protein as cow’s milk. Rice milk typically provides minimal protein and is higher in carbohydrates. Almond milk is usually quite low in protein and also less calorically dense, she said. Plant protein tends to be of a lower quality than dairy proteins, though soy is close, said John Lucey, a food scientist who directs the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our own review of labels found that soy and almond beverages, like cow’s milk, are all relatively low calorie, low carbohydrate, low sodium drinks. They are all heavy with calcium. But they feature a different mix of vitamins and minerals, and fat content. Examples: soy milk has a lot of folate, while cow’s milk typically has none; cow’s milk contains some Vitamin C, but the soy, almond and hemp drinks we examined have none. Almond and soy milks feature some iron and fiber -- nutrients typically not found in cow’s milk. ""All the products profile differently,"" said Susan Levin, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition education for the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. Bottom line: Baldwin’s nutrition observation is on target, based on a comparison of milk products. Our rating Baldwin claimed that imitation dairy products made from plants often differ nutritionally from the real thing, and labeling them ""milk"" or ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" is ""against the law.""

He did mandate health care for Massachusetts, which is HillaryCare, and he doesn't want to do that for America.""",true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/10/rudy-giuliani/romney-wants-a-different-prescription-for-the-nati/,"There are several pieces to this, so we'll take them one at a time. First, Massachusetts: As governor, Mitt Romney oversaw a major rewrite of the state's health care program in 2006 that featured a mandate on individuals. Everyone in the state must enroll in a plan or face tax penalties. It's true that Romney vetoed the teeth behind part of the mandate — a charge to companies that didn't offer coverage to employees — which was later overridden by the state Legislature. So, Giuliani is correct that Romney enacted a ""mandate"" plan, though Romney has sought to avoid that term. Giuliani also is correct that the program in Massachusetts shares some things with the health care proposal put forward by Sen. Hillary Clinton. Both expand upon the current private-public system. Neither forces changes for those who like their current employer-provided insurance. Both aim to provide coverage for all, with subsidized private plans. And both mandate coverage by penalizing those who can afford to buy a plan but don't. Now, does that mean the Massachusetts program is ""HillaryCare""? We'll take a pass on judging that one. Giuliani's other point is that Romney isn't proposing a national plan similar to what he did in Massachusetts. That's true, too. Romney has argued that population demographics vary so much by state that a universal plan can't be applied across the country. Instead, he has proposed changing the way federal dollars are made available to states — which is what Massachusetts was able to do — so states are free to draw up plans that suit themselves.

98,pomt-08017,Obama’s mid-term approval ratings are similar to other presidents who went on to re-election.,half-true,/virginia/statements/2011/jan/10/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-obamas-approval-ratings-fine-compar/,"With Democrats woozy from their shellacking in November’s congressional elections, political junkies are riveted on 2012 and whether President Barack Obama will win a second term. No one is putting a better spin on Obama’s fortunes than Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He wrote an end-of-the year column for Politico, a Washington news organization, saying Obama’s ""list of achievements already dwarfs that of many presidents."" Kaine, a former Virginia governor, encountered skepticism during a TV interview last Sunday. Ed Henry, CNN’s senior White House corespondent, noted Obama’s approval rating from voters dropped 6 percentage points in 2010. ""You made your case but it seems like the American people aren’t buying it, sir,"" Henry said. Kaine replied, ""Relatively, if you look at the president’s mid-term numbers compared to other presidents in their mid-term, he’s fine."" We decided to take a closer look. Kaine was responding to a Gallup poll conducted in the final week of December that showed 47 percent of adult Americans approved of Obama’s job performance, 45 percent disapproved and 8 percent were undecided. First, we asked for clarification of what Kaine meant when he said Obama is ""fine."" Alec Gerlach, a DNC press secretary, said Kaine meant Obama’s mid-term poll numbers ""are in the neighborhood of other presidents who got re-elected, including Reagan and Clinton."" So for this fact-check we will focus on whether Obama's ratings are indeed similar to presidents who got re-elected. Then we researched polls by Gallup because it has the longest record of tracking presidential popularity, dating to 1937 when Franklin Roosevelt was beginning his second term. We compared Obama’s numbers to the approval ratings other presidents received at the start of the year after mid-term congressional elections. To keep the comparison consistent, we turned to the first Gallup poll on Obama completely conducted in 2011. A survey from Jan. 2 to Jan. 4 found the president had 49 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval and 6 percent were undecided on his job perfromance. The average mid-term mark for presidents -- from Roosevelt in 1939 through Obama in 2011 -- is 53.5 percent approval, 36 percent disapproval and 10.5 percent undecided. Obama seems to be in the neighborhood, but not on the best street. Let’s look at the presidents who got reelected in that time span. Their average mid-term approval was 57 percent and disapproval was 35 percent. Obama is not in that school district. But neither were Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton midway through their first terms. Then they moved up quickly. Reagan was the least popular mid-term president. At the start of 1983, with the nation emerging from recession, he had 37 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval. Less than two years later, Reagan carried all but one state in a landslide reelection. Bill Clinton’s numbers at the start of 1995 were similar to Obama’s today. Clinton had 47 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval. In 1996, he was easily reelected. In contrast, George H.W. Bush had a robust 59 percent approval rating in early 1991 only to lose reelection the next year. All told, we were able to find the last 19 mid-term presidential polls by Gallup. Obama’s approval rating is the 11th highest. Of the eight presidents below him, four times their party retained the White House in the next election, and four times it didn’t. Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, says mid-term polls are a horrible gauge of coming elections because a president’s popularity can soar or plummet with events. ""They don’t say a thing,"" he said. ""The numbers that matter are the votes of people and, considering the beating Democrats took on Nov. 7, the president is by no means OK, assured of a successful term or a second one."" Let’s review. Kaine, with his spokesman’s elaboration, said Obama’s mid-term polling popularity is ""fine"" compared to other presidents who went on to re-election. Kaine is correct in saying that Obama’s numbers compare favorably to Reagan and Clinton. But the president’s mid-term approval rating -- gauged by the first poll completely conducted in the new mid-term year -- is 8 percentage points below the average of re-elected presidents since 1939. His disapproval rating is 10 percentage points above the average. We know those numbers can change in an instant. But when a politician is down by 8 or 10 percentage points, we say he’s behind but within striking distance.

Hartzler said drugs posed a significant problem in her district. Employers, she said, tell her they cannot find an employee to fill a position because applicants can’t pass a drug test, while military recruiters say they have to turn away otherwise exceptional recruits because of drug use. Hartzler talked about her years teaching at-risk teenagers and cited a widespread drug problem in the United States and one of its most sobering effects: the displacement of children into foster care. ""Twenty-five percent of our kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs,"" Hartzler said. Certainly drug use by parents can lead to state intervention, but is the number of reported cases really this high? Foster care According to the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, there are 397,122 children living in the foster system without permanent families. Hartzler has long been an advocate for the advancement of foster care, even co-publishing an article on its problems. Kyle Buckles, Hartzler’s communications director, pointed us toward the Green Book. Each year, statistics are compiled into the House of Representative’s Green Book, which is used to provide background material and data on the programs run by the Ways and Means Committee, including foster care. Foster care statistics Circumstance of Removal FY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013 Drug abuse (parent) 26.1 26.2 28.5 28.1 Alcohol abuse (parent) 7.6 6.3 6.3 5.6 Without considering alcohol, drug use by the parent was above 25 percent from 2010 through 2013, for which data is available. When alcohol is factored in, this number is more than 30 percent. Drug use is the second largest cause of the removal of children from their parent’s custody. The most prevalent circumstance for removal is neglect, which is present in over half of the cases in the United States — but it is important to remember that more than one factor may be cited in a particular case. For example, a child may be removed from his parents’ custody for neglect, parental drug abuse and child drug abuse. The problem appears to be getting worse. A 2009 study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that between the years 2002 and 2007, 12 percent of children between the ages of six to 11 were living with a parent who abused drugs or alcohol. Take Back the District Hartzler’s initiative has since met once to discuss the district’s drug issues. Her goal was to bring together law enforcement, parents, school officials, community leaders and citizens. The program met early on Oct. 19, where Hartzler, speakers and guests discussed the issuesand possible solutions to the problem and then diverted to a ""Faith-Based Rehabilitation and Ministry"" panel discussion. Our ruling Hartzler claimed that a quarter of children in foster care were there because of their parent’s drug abuse. Her claim is a modest estimation of the issue, according to reliable data kept by Congress. Drug abuse by parents is the second most prevalent reason for a parent losing custody of a child to foster care services.

100,pomt-06414,"""After every major conflict ... what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/26/leon-panetta/leon-panetta-says-military-has-hollowed-out-after-/,"In congressional testimony reported in a New York Times article on Oct. 23, 2011, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned against cutting defense spending too severely as the U.S. winds down its involvement in Iraq and reconsiders how to proceed in Afghanistan. ""After every major conflict — World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union — what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts that impacted on equipment, impacted on training, impacted on capability,"" Panetta said. ""Whatever we do in confronting the challenges we face now on the fiscal side, we must not make that mistake."" After a reader pointed out this quote to us, we decided it was worth checking. Before starting our analysis, we’ll note a few factors. First, on the statistical side, we’ll look overall defense spending, and troop levels. For spending, experts told us that the best figures to use are inflation-adjusted, annual totals. Second, the definition of the key phrase Panetta used -- ""hollowing out"" -- is open to interpretation. ""‘Hollowing out’ is a rather imprecise term that is floating around the Pentagon a lot these days,"" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent think tank on defense and related spending. ""It can mean not providing troops with adequate pay and benefits so that the best ones leave. It can mean not providing troops with adequate training, leaving them unprepared for combat. Or it can mean providing troops with substandard equipment, poorly maintained equipment or an insufficient quantity of equipment. When Panetta and others in the Pentagon say this, I’m not sure if they mean all of these things happened in the past or just some of them."" The Pentagon did not respond to a query seeking data and background to support Panetta’s point, so we turned to a range of military experts and historians to assess whether the U.S. military experienced a ""hollowing out"" as Panetta said. Now, let’s look at some numbers. For spending, we measured the decline from the peak spending year of the war to the lowest level within five years after hostilities ended. The full details of our methodology can be found here, but the bottom line is that defense spending fell after World War II by 92 percent, after the Korean War by 53 percent, after the Vietnam War by 26 percent and after the Cold War by 28 percent. As for worldwide troop levels, they fell by 27 percent after the Korean War, by 40 percent after the Vietnam War and by 32 percent after the Cold War. (The data we found did not include numbers for the aftermath of World War I, or for troop levels after World War II.) What both of these measurements show is that for the periods following Korea, Vietnam and the end of the Cold War, both defense spending and worldwide troop levels declined by about one-quarter to one-half within a few years. So Panetta has a point. Still, determining whether these declines led to a ""hollowing out"" requires looking at more than just the raw numbers. After all, it’s no surprise that both military spending and troop levels would decline after a war concludes. A more relevant question is whether the decreases were severe enough in their scope and composition to hurt the United States’ ability to act militarily, given the threats the nation faced at the time. This is more of a judgment call, and the experts we contacted expressed some ambivalence. ""The accuracy of Panetta's statement largely hinges on how you define ‘hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the board cuts,’"" said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University. ""His point is that during periods of budget cutting, we have to make smart choices, rather than cutting everything back the same amount, and that our choices have to reflect the threats we'll face in the future. That's a point I suspect most people would agree with. My caveat is that his use of historical examples is a bit suspect, and doesn't reflect the political realities that governed defense spending during the 20th century."" Let’s take a look at the political, economic and military contexts surrounding each of the post-war periods Panetta cited. Post-World War I The cuts made after World War I are universally considered to have been major. But at least one historian we contacted believes that the damage to American military capabilities has been overstated. ""We did make huge cuts in defense spending after World War I, but that was to be expected after waging a massive conflict in Europe and was vital in that we could not have sustained wartime spending levels indefinitely,"" Janda said. ""The cuts made sense in that we faced no serious threat to the continental United States, and they were unavoidable in a political environment that by the mid 1920s had concluded that our involvement in World War I had been a mistake."" The arrival of the Great Depression in 1929 made the need for cuts even more urgent, Janda said. He added that the largest cuts came in Army spending, under the belief that the Navy was the nation’s first line of defense and critical to protecting overseas possessions. Once it became clear in the late 1930s that conflict with Japan and Germany was likely, military spending began to rise again. ""Should we have started sooner? Maybe,"" Janda said. ""Should we have spent more on the Army? Yes. But that's in hindsight, and it's not like the cuts of the 1920s were still haunting us in 1939. So I think that while Mr. Panetta is right about the fact that we cut defense spending after World War I, he's overstating the case to argue that those cuts ‘hollowed out’ the force that existed when we were threatened almost 20 years later."" Post-World War II The decline in defense spending after World War II was massive and rapid. The U.S. Army shrank from 89 divisions in 1945 to 10 in 1950, said Ted Wilson, a historian at the University of Kansas. In this context, June 1950 -- the start of the Korean War -- came as ""a rude awakening,"" said William W. Stueck, historian at the University of Georgia. Unlike the two-decade period between the world wars, the Korean War came about five years after the end of World War II, and for this reason it has become a poster child for the dangers of a ""hollowed out"" military. But even here the situation is more complicated. Janda notes that, as after World War I, cuts were made because ""our wartime spending levels were politically and economically unsustainable. Did we hollow out the force? I don't think so. It dramatically shrunk in size, to be sure, but we still had the largest navy and air force on the planet. What cost us in Korea in 1950 was that the veterans of World War II had largely gone home, and the Army was composed of draftees with no combat experience. It's also true that our tanks and bazookas could have been better, and that the Army took the brunt of the cuts between 1945 and 1950. But again, that was because we made a choice and decided that in a world with nuclear weapons that we were better off putting the bulk of our resources into the Air Force and the Navy as our first line of defense."" Post-Korean War Unlike the enormous decreases following both World Wars, the aftermath of the Korean War was the first in a series of more modest cutbacks. The key difference is that by then the Cold War was underway, and the U.S. determined that a standing military -- one backed by cutting-edge technology from a permanent defense industry -- was necessary. After the Korean War, President Dwight Eisenhower ""continued to see a high-level -- even an expanding -- security threat from the Soviet Union,"" Stueck said. But because of concerns that high military spending could be a threat to the U.S. economy, Eisenhower made substantial cuts in the Army (his old branch), though he increased Air Force spending. When John F. Kennedy entered office, he pursued an expansion of the defense budget even before the escalation in Vietnam. Both Janda and Harrison see this period as a weak link in Panetta’s claim. ""Eisenhower made a number of deliberate decisions in the early 1950s to shift the focus of military strategy from fighting major ground wars like Korea to using nuclear deterrence to stop Soviet expansion,"" Harrison said. ""These were not blind, across-the-board cuts, as Panetta suggests, but rather were targeted cuts that reflected a shift in strategy."" Post-Vietnam War The term ""hollowed out"" is most widely associated with the post-Vietnam era, when the United States was recovering from an unpopular war. There’s wide consensus that military readiness -- not to mention a willingness to intervene militarily -- slumped in the 1970s, which provides some support for Panetta’s claim. But even here, several experts said that the ""hollowing out"" had a lot to do with the military’s shift from the draft to an all-volunteer force -- an important transformational change that caused some short-term challenges. ""After the all-volunteer force was instituted in 1973 and wages increased to attract quality volunteers, morale rose to new peaks,"" said Tim Kane, a senior fellow at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Another factor was more obscure -- procurement decisions made under President Richard Nixon. ""The biggest problem we had in the 1970s was that we needed new tanks and aircraft, and we didn't have them because of decisions made in the 1960s and early 1970s by the Nixon administration, the Army, and the Air Force,"" Janda said. Systems like the M-1 Abrams, the B-1 bomber, the MX Missile, Cruise missiles and stealth fighters were in the pipeline, he said, but they were ready only by the time Ronald Reagan became president, he said. So while the term ""hollowing out"" may be apt for the post-Vietnam period, it’s more of a stretch to say it was caused by ""deep, across-the-board cuts."" Post-Cold War There was a ""peace dividend"" after the end of the Cold War, but it was limited by the rapid emergence of the Persian Gulf War. And during the 1990s, the United States participated in a large number of limited military interventions in such places as Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Haiti and the no-fly zones in Iraq, often using air power, sometimes combined with specialized ground forces. ""Were we ‘hollowed out?’ No,"" Janda said. ""We were still the most powerful nation on the planet. But we had to make choices, just like the Romans did 2,000 years ago when they stopped expanding and limited the number of legions in the Roman Army. No nation can afford to spend too much on defense."" Our ruling Panetta said that ""after every major conflict — World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union — what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts."" He’s correct that spending and troop levels fell -- enormously after the World Wars, more modestly after the other conflicts. But there’s less consensus that the cuts -- particularly the ones that followed after the conclusion of Korean War and the Cold War -- led to a ""hollowed out"" force. We think it’s a stretch to suggest, as Panetta does, that cuts were made across the board. In most cases, the cuts weren’t knee-jerk but were in fact made with a larger strategy in mind. On balance, we rate Panetta’s comment Half True. CORRECTION: The quote checked in this item was made at a congressional hearing.

One viral image points to Japan as an example of a country that keeps out radical Islam by cracking down on all forms of Islam and its adherents, implying that this is a good model for the United States to follow. The graphic is a simple black-and-white block of text with the headline, ""Japan keeps Islam at bay by putting restrictions on Islam and ALL Muslims."" The graphic then mentions a variety of ways in which Japan supposedly keeps tight control over the Muslims in its midst: • ""Japan is the only nation that does not give citizenship to Muslims"" • ""Permanent residency is not given to Muslims"" • ""Propagation of Islam in Japan is banned"" • ""In the University of Japan, Arabic or any Islamic language is not taught"" • ""Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries"" • ""One cannot import a ‘Koran’ published in the Arabic language"" • ""Muslims must follow Japanese law and language"". • ""The Japanese government is of the opinion that Muslims are fundamentalist, and unwilling to change their Muslim laws"" • ""Muslims cannot even rent a house in Japan"" • ""There is no sharia law in Japan"" We wondered whether the graphic is accurate. To streamline our analysis, we focused mostly on these four claims -- that in Japan, ""permanent residency is not given to Muslims,"" the ""propagation of Islam"" is banned, ""one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,"" and ""Muslims cannot even rent a house."" We heard back from three experts who have experience with the intersection of Japan and Islam, and all three said the graphic is blatantly incorrect. ""The chain email is nothing but malicious falsehood,"" said Kumiko Yagi, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School who has written extensively about Islam and other religions. Kamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, agreed, saying that all four of the claims we spotlighted are wrong. He said Japan doesn’t discriminate in permanent residency on the basis of religion and that ""propagation"" of Islam is not banned. He added that the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported. As for renting a residence, he said there may be some reluctance among residents of Japan to rent apartments to foreigners as a general rule, but he said there’s no specific animus toward Muslims. These four claims ""are totally unfounded,"" said Glenda S. Roberts, a professor of cultural anthropology and Japanese studies at the graduate school of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. ""It is disturbing that such an email is circulating,"" she added. ""These claims are simply ridiculous."" Other claims in the graphic are easily debunked. For instance, the graphic claims that ""Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries."" Yet a quick visit to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website shows that Japan has embassies in such countries as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, plus a permanent representative to the Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, there is nothing in Japanese nationality law that prevents Muslims from becoming naturalized citizens. The requirements concern length of residency, age, a history of ""upright conduct,"" the ability to support oneself and a willingness to give up other nationalities. There is no mention of religion. As for universities not teaching Arabic, we found that the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies does. Classes in Arabic are also taught at the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo. Last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear Japan’s respect for people of the Islamic faith during an event with the Islamic diplomatic corps. ""I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others,"" Abe said. ""I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence."" Our ruling The graphic says that in Japan, ""permanent residency is not given to Muslims,"" the ""propagation of Islam"" is banned, ""one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,"" and ""Muslims cannot even rent a house.""

""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."" He also said: ""By the way, they hacked -- they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see."" Clinton’s lawyers had turned over work-related emails but deleted thousands that she said were about personal matters. FBI Director James Comey said earlier that month that Clinton should have known that some of the emails stored on private servers in her New York home were classified, but concluded there wasn’t enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information. Although the Justice Department declined to prosecute, Trump continued to hammer Clinton for the email controversy: ""That gives me a big problem,"" Trump said in Doral. ""After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 emails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them."" When Katy Tur, an NBC reporter, asked Trump whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, Trump snapped back: ""Be quiet. I know you want to save (Clinton)."" Trump also attacked the DNC over thousands of leaked emails published by WikiLeaks in July. Those emails showed its leaders — including party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida — favored Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders. Two days later Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative, announced she would step down from her party post. As for any invitation to Russia to hack emails, a Trump campaign spokesman told PolitiFact that Trump said he was being ""sarcastic"" in an interview that Fox News posted the next day. Trump told Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, ""You have to be kidding. His client, his person, deleted 33,000 emails illegally. You look at that. And when I’m being sarcastic with something ...""

104,pomt-05575,"""More children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry.""",true,/georgia/statements/2012/apr/04/rashad-taylor/federal-stats-back-labor-deaths-claim/,"Most nonbinding resolutions that come before the Georgia House of Representatives garner little debate, but one involving child labor laws got a little testy. Some House members were angry about a U.S. Department of Labor proposal they say would make it tougher for children to work on the family farm. Agriculture is Georgia’s largest industry. So Georgia lawmakers wrote House Resolution 1561, which said the federal agency ""seeks to impose harsh, extreme, and uncalled for regulations attempting to ban students from working on farms."" Not so, said Rep. Rashad Taylor, an Atlanta Democrat who opposed the resolution. Taylor said he’s worried about the safety of children working on some farms. He offered several amendments to the resolution, claiming portions of it were incorrect. Taylor’s argument included a claim that some lawmakers quickly disputed. ""More children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry,"" he said. One lawmaker suggested more children die playing football than from agricultural work. Another suggested the numbers may be higher because more children work in agriculture than other industries. Rep. Penny Houston, a Republican from South Georgia, asked Taylor several pointed questions that suggested she didn’t think the lawmaker from the big city understood the issue. Her questions included a query wondering if Taylor had ever picked peas. We dug deep on Taylor’s claim. Currently, minors may be employed by their parents at any time in any occupation on a farm owned or operated by his or her parents. Unfortunately, there’s not much research on child labor deaths. The most recent data came to us from a department within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They put together a spreadsheet using Bureau of Labor Statistics data to determine the number of children 18 and under who died on the job between 2003 and 2010. During that time, there were 311 deaths nationwide. Nearly half of those deaths, 151, were in the agriculture industry, the data showed. A CDC spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that 73 percent of all work-related deaths for children 15 and under were in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. They did not have a more specific breakdown for all industries. A 2006 study by two CDC researchers reached similar conclusions. The study was based on two sets of data from 1992 to 2002. In that report, they noted research that found an astounding 79 percent of all work-related deaths for youths 10 years of age and younger occurred in agriculture production. ""As a proportion of all young workers, young workers in agriculture production incur a disproportionate share of fatalities,"" the 2006 report says. The National Consumers League puts out an annual list of the most dangerous occupations for teenagers. In 2011, the most dangerous industry for young people 18 and younger was agriculture, with a death rate of 21.3 per 100,000 full-time employees, according to the report. Another report we saw, using BLS data, showed between 1992 and 1998 that nearly 43 percent of work-related fatalities for children 18 and younger were due to agricultural work. The second-highest percentage of fatalities was in retail trade. So why are a high proportion of children losing their lives in agriculture industries? One report found the most common cause of death of youths in agriculture is from farm machinery, such as a harvester or tractor. Between 1992 and 1997, 51 deaths of youths in agriculture nationwide could be specifically attributed to overturned tractors. Other research shows a high number of falls from moving vehicles or mobile equipment and being struck by the same. There are few reports on this subject, and there are very few deaths to study. But everything we’ve seen shows a high percentage of work-related deaths among children occur in agriculture. The most recent data shows it is nearly 50 percent. The numbers seem to back up Taylor’s claim. For the record, Taylor’s efforts to amend the resolution failed. The resolution passed. Maybe PolitiFact’s ruling will give Taylor some solace. Maybe not.

105,pomt-00564,"The film and TV industry supports more than 24,000 direct jobs and pays local workers more than $1.68 billion in wages in Georgia.",mostly true,/georgia/statements/2015/jun/12/motion-picture-association-america/federal-data-backs-claim-about-movie-and-tv-jobs/,"Georgia’s lucrative tax credits for movie and TV production generate more than just the chance to spot Betty White and Chris Evans noshing in restaurants around Atlanta. The industry also supports more than 24,000 jobs and pays more than $1.68 billion in wages to those workers, according to a press release this week from the Motion Picture Association of America. That’s the equivalent of the entire population of the city of Decatur working in an industry that in 2013 saw $261 million spent on location in shoots in Georgia, according to a 2013 report from a nonprofit that tracks English-language film production worldwide. So, PolitiFact Georgia thought those numbers seemed high but plausible – especially if you count the hordes of zombies needed every week in ""The Walking Dead."" We decided to check it out. First, it’s worth knowing that the MPAA released its data for Georgia and other states as part of a hard push of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), in which Congress defines negotiating priorities for trade agreements. In this case, the Senate has approved but the House has yet to vote on providing ""fast track"" authority for President Obama to speed a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (TPP) through Congress. In other words, the deal would expand trade and access for Atlanta’s zombies – not to mention ""The Hunger Games"" franchise and the Evans’ now-filming ""Captain America: Civil War"" – to much of the Asia-Pacific region, said MPAA spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. ""The movies made in Georgia are reaching a global audience, and it’s important we can access those markets with as little friction as possible,"" Bedingfield said. ""The jobs grown in Georgia are dependent on being able to market those products easily overseas."" Georgia has heavily incentivized the industry in recent years to lure projects. Production companies can earn a 20 percent income tax credit on in-state costs of projects worth at least $500,000. Another 10 percent credit is given for using a Georgia logo in production credits. The MPAA used the federal government’s own data, compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, in calculating the total job and wage estimates. The BLS data broad categories of motion pictures and broadcasting show an annual average of 20,869 employees and total annual wages of $1.55 billion in 2013. But the MPAA drills down deeper into those broad categories and others, excluding the recording artists covered in the broad category but captures jobs from other categories – such as payroll workers and electricians – it can show work in the film or TV industry, said Julia Jenks, the vice president of research for the MPAA. In some of those more specific groups, such as cable TV production, all of the jobs and pay count toward the MPAA tally. Others, such as costume rental and wardrobe, are counted based on U.S. Census or research calculations that tell what proportion of those jobs work in the industry. The MPAA calls that its adjustment factor on the government figures. ""It’s our best estimate, and a very conservative estimate,"" Jenks said. Using those parameters, the BLS counts 48,539 jobs but the MPAA tally for Georgia is 24,162: Job Code Description BLS total Adjustment MPAA total 334614 Audio/Video Reproduction 152 68.7% 104 512110 Motion Picture Video & Production 3,864 100% 3,864 512120 Motion Picture & Video Distribution 22 100% 22 512191 Teleproduction, Other Post Production 148 42% 62 512199 Other Motion Picture & Video 59 100% 59 532220 Formal Wear/Costume Rental 623 3% 19 532490 Other Machinery Rental, Leasing 1,349 6% 81 541214 Payroll 15,739 30% 4,722 561311 Employment Placement 6,198 1% 62 711510 Independent artists, writers 1,291 23% 297 423990 Prerecorded Video Wholesale 1,738 12% 209 512131 Movie Theaters (except drive-ins) 3,348 100% 3,348 512132 Drive-in Theaters 45 100% 45 515120 Television Broadcasting 7,138 100% 7,138 515210 Cable & Subscription Programming 3,670 100% 3,670 519130 Internet Publishing & Broadcasting 2,778 3% 83 532230 Video & Disk Rental 377 100% 377 Using the BLS tables, PolitiFact Georgia was able to replicate all of the job figures, except in three categories. The 2013 quarterly census shows 303 jobs in audio/video reproduction – exactly double the MPAA’s count. And, the official BLS data does not have an annual average for jobs in the one category few think of as a movie industry gig: working in movie and drive-in theaters, economist Timothy Ewing said. A nine-month average is available for those jobs, which have high turnover. But that means they are comparable to the yearly figures in other categories. Ewing could not comment on the adjustments the MPAA made in categories, other than to note it would create more conservative estimates. So, using the BLS-confirmed data, and the MPAA’s own adjustments, the total number of jobs drops to 20,873. But the MPAA is conservative in other ways. It does not include at all freelance workers common in production, who provide contract work in, say, makeup or construction. PolitiFact Georgia recently showed that Tyler Perry’s new studio planned for Fort McPherson will alone create between 2,000 to 6,000 of those jobs. It is reasonable to think the MPAA could easily reach its 24,000 jobs figure if it counted contract work on the 23 movies or 39 TV series filmed in Georgia in 2013. The question remains if those jobs, and their pay, are truly Georgia jobs. The state incentive allows movie companies to get credits on what they pay stars, and accountants, for the time they work in the state. Our ruling The MPAA released data this week to bolster its lobbying to fast-track a trade deal that would open more of Asia to its content. It claimed the industry supported 24,000 direct jobs and paid workers more than $1.68 billion in the Peach State in 2013. Federal data confirms nearly all of the job figures and payroll, many of which have been reduced from the official headcount. The MPAA overreaches in deciding movie theater workers such as ushers are industry workers, versus retail employees. But those jobs would likely be outweighed by freelance workers on production sets, which the MPAA did not count in its tally.

106,pomt-08777,"U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall (D-Ga.) refuses to return $37,000 in ""dirty"" campaign contributions from U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.)",half-true,/georgia/statements/2010/aug/23/national-republican-congressional-committee/marshall/,"Republicans are raising questions about a controversial campaign contributor to a Democratic Georgia congressman. The National Republican Congressional Committee put together a recorded telephone message that it said went to residents on Aug. 10 in Democrat Jim Marshall's congressional district in Middle Georgia. The message said U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, who is in a heap of ethics trouble, made $37,000 in campaign contributions to Marshall. Rangel, a Democrat from New York City, is facing 13 ethics charges largely surrounding whether he used his office for personal gain. Rangel admits to belatedly reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars in income and assets. But Rangel insists he's not corrupt. The RNCC urges Marshall in the message to give the money back. ""So far, Congressman Marshall's fellow Democrats have returned almost $640,000 in dirty campaign money from Rangel,"" the unidentified voice in the message says. ""Yet, Congressman Marshall refuses to return $37,000."" Is a New York congressman who is under an ethics cloud helping fund the campaign of a Middle Georgia congressman running for re-election? AJC PolitiFact Georgia contacted Marshall's office about the NRCC allegation. Our initial search of federal campaign contributions from Rangel for Congress showed the congressman sent just $9,000 to Marshall. Marshall's spokesman Doug Moore said the GOP has included money from a political action committee Rangel is involved with called ""National Leadership PAC."" In all, Moore said Marshall has received $38,000. But that money arrived before Rangel's ethics problems, Moore said. A leadership PAC is a fundraising device politicians to back other candidates. National Leadership PAC is Rangel's PAC. It collects money that is then doled out to other Democrats running for office. Moore called it a ""technicality"" to say the money from the National Leadership PAC is from Rangel. Moore argued the message is misleading because all of contributions were made by 2007, a year before the ethics allegations surfaced. Marshall has since refused to accept contributions from Rangel or the PAC, Moore said. Marshall represents Georgia's 8th Congressional District, which includes Macon and much of Middle Georgia. It's considered a swing district that Republicans are eager to seize this fall in their attempt to win control of Congress. Marshall has won several close races in recent years. Linking him to Rangel, a liberal with ethics issues, could damage Marshall this election cycle, experts say. ""(Republicans) are trying to say this guy might be dirty like the rest of them,"" said Emory University associate political science professor Michael Leo Owens. Marshall is trying to distance himself from such comparisons. He told PolitiFact Georgia in a statement that ""if Rangel is indeed guilty of the charges, he should have resigned a long time ago."" Anthony Corrado, an expert in campaign finance laws, said it is common practice for members of Congress to give money from their PACs to fellow members facing tough re-election battles. The National Leadership PAC donated $899,000 to various Democratic candidates in 2008, said Corrado, a government professor at Colby College in Maine. National Leadership is probably one of the top 10 PACs in terms of donations, Corrado said. Corrado said candidates return money to someone or an organization that becomes politically liable. However, he said that Rangel giving money to Marshall during the last election cycle does not carry the same weight as if the contributions were made after Rangel's ethics allegations went public. ""It's not the same,"" he said. Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint agreed with Owens that the RNCC is smart to attempt to link Marshall with Rangel. However, Swint said the robocall is ""slightly misleading"" because it does not mention that contributions were made before the ethics allegations emerged. ""That's politics,"" Swint said. ""All is fair."" So is the NRCC's message correct? The total amount of money was off by $1,000. But a point that concerned us more is that the contributions were made before the allegations surfaced. Anyone who hears the message would not know from it when the contributions were made, which made a difference to every expert we spoke with. We believe the statement does contain some truth. But it leaves out important details and takes some things out of context.

107,pomt-10943,"In New York City, ""for every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/ocasio-cortez-new-york-city-there-are-3-vacant-apa/,"New York Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has put poverty and inequality at the center of her campaign. On Twitter, she focused on troubles in the New York City housing market. New York City is experiencing the highest rate of homelessness since the Great Depression,"" she wrote July 23. ""For every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments. Inequality is a crisis, and a bold, 21st-century effort on poverty must advance."" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Ocasio-Cortez’s stat about the number of homeless and the number of vacant apartments caught our eye. Key takeaways There are about 63,000 homeless people in New York City, and the number of vacant housing units is in the range of 150,000 to 180,000. Given the number of families, the actual number of homeless households seeking permanent shelter is about 32,000, and the number of apartments available for rent is closer to 79,000. The numbers lack great precision but in large measure, the 1-to-3 ratio is about right. The math on the homeless count Campaign spokesman Jeff Latzer told us that ""numbers vary, but there’s roughly 63,495 homeless and 247,977 vacancies."" With those numbers, there are 3.8 empty places for each homeless person. Let’s look at the sources behind both figures. Official reports back up the homeless count. New York City’s Homeless Services Department’s May survey had 62,147 individuals staying in temporary housing. That stat overstates the number of apartments needed, because it includes children in families. The advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless in New York City says the actual number of homeless households, both families and single adults, is closer to 32,000. Turning to vacancies, the city’s 2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey did find 247,977 ""vacant units, not available for sale or rent."" But before we dive into that big number, the survey found another 79,000 vacant apartments that were actually on the rental market. That’s the number Giselle Routhier, the homeless coalition’s policy director, focuses on. Routhier compared it to the number of apartments needed, not the number of homeless people. ""There are about 2.5 vacant rental apartments for every homeless household in New York City,"" Routhier said. ""But the problem is even worse than the point-in-time data. New York City loses thousands of affordable apartment every year through rent increases and deregulation. Between 1996 and 2017, New York City lost more than 1.1 million housing units with contract rents below $800 per month."" Routhier’s way of looking at the city’s costly housing market is very different from Ocasio-Cortez’s, but the final numbers are reasonably close. Routhier said about 2.5 and Ocasio-Cortez said about three. Matthew Gordon Lasner, associate professor of urban studies at Hunter College, warned that the focus on math only takes you so far. ""The comparison she’s making — no matter the ratio or numbers — is really a rhetorical device, to point out that the city has the capacity to house all its residents,"" Lasner said. When a vacancy isn’t a vacancy So now let’s get back to that big number of nearly 248,000 ""vacant units, not available for sale or rent."" It’s not what it might seem. The total includes 58,000 units ""undergoing renovation"" and another 22,000 rented or sold ""but not yet occupied."" All told, about 129,000 units are vacant due to one process or another that takes them out of the active housing market. 2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey Total rental units 2,183,064 Occupied 2,103,874 Vacant, available 79,190 Vacant units, not available for sale or rent 247,977 Held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use 74,945 Rented, not yet occupied 10,960 Sold, not yet occupied 11,156 Undergoing renovation 58,347 Awaiting renovation 20,283 In legal dispute 9,626 Held pending sale of building 5,886 Owner’s personal problems (age, illness, etc.) 12,719 Held for other reasons 27,009 But that still leaves nearly 75,000 units in the category of ""held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use."" These are the pied-à-terre of the well-to-do, and sometimes, the super-duper-well-to-do. ""A bit of that is new – global billionaires parking money in Midtown condos,"" said Lasner. ""But New York’s always had tens of thousands of suburbanites, U.S. out-of-towners, and foreigners keeping apartments. That’s been the case for centuries in all important business and government centers."" Lasner prefers to focus on what he called a practical figure — the number of units that could be on the market ""with a few nudges or tweaks of the law."" For him, between the available and the unavailable vacancies, the baseline is in the range of 150,000 to 180,000. How Ocasio-Cortez’s ratio stacks up Taking Ocasio-Cortez’s count of homeless people, and estimating 150,000 and 180,000 vacancies, the ratio falls to 1 person for between 2.4 and nearly 3 apartments. If instead we use the number of homeless households, the ratio could get to the neighborhood of 1-to-6 (32,000 households for 180,000 vacancies). Pushing further, comparing homeless households to just the number of vacant apartments truly on the market (79,000 divided by 32,000), the result is 1-to-2.4. Our ruling Ocasio-Cortez said that ""for every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments."" The number of homeless people is about 63,000. The number of vacant apartments is harder to judge, but no matter how we jiggered the numbers, the lowest ratio we found was 1-to-2.4. And the high could get close to 1-to-6. There’s a lot push and pull in the underlying statistics, but in the main, Ocasio-Cortez’s math holds up. We rate this claim Mostly True.

We said False. Now Atwater is firing back with a trio of claims against Ausley in an ad of his own. The ad is called ""Two Liberals,"" and liberally tries to tie Ausley to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yes, they are both Democrats and women. ""This Washington liberal is raising taxes and wrecking our economy. Now, Pelosi has Loranne Ausley, the Tallahassee politician who wants total control ... of our money,"" a narrator says. ""Watch out, because Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors. ""Pelosi and Ausley -- too liberal too costly."" Like Ausley's ad attacking Atwater, we're fact-checking the whole of the three specific claims -- that Ausley, a former member of the Florida House, pushed gas taxes, property taxes and taxes as seniors. Our analysis reveals a political art -- clever wording. Gas taxes Ausley didn't push for increased gas taxes as a member of the state House. Instead, she voted against a one-month, eight-cent reduction of the gas tax back in 2004. Here are the details. The bill, HB 237, reduced the state gas tax from 14.3 cents to 6.3 cents in August 2004, and also created a back-to-school sales tax holiday for school items $50 or less. The proposal passed with broad bipartisan support: 107-8 in the House and 34-4 in the Senate. Ausley was one of the eight no votes in the House. Atwater, a member of the state Senate, voted yes. But that didn't mean the measure was completely popular. Newspaper editorials argued the loss in state revenue for temporarily lowering the gas tax -- about $60 million -- wasn't worth the small savings to drivers. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune editorial board calculated that the average driver would save a ""whopping"" $3.67. ""Don't spend it all in one place,"" they wrote. ""Loranne voted to keep the existing tax structure in place, as well as against the entire budget that year because of the lack of funding for important issues like boosting teacher salaries and the critical funding of Florida KidCare,"" Ausley spokesman Kevin Cate said. It's worth noting that the idea of a gas tax holiday resurfaced in 2008 and was being pushed by Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist asked state Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, to file an amendment to a revenue bill (SB 1838) that would suspend 10 cents of the state's gas tax for a two-week period from July 1-14. But the amendment was never heard in the GOP-controlled Senate and Atwater, as a senator, didn't have to take a vote on the measure. Neither did Ausley, who was in the House. Property taxes Ausley didn't push for increased property taxes as a member of the state House. Instead, she voted against Republican proposals to cut property taxes. Here are the details. During a special session in June 2007, Ausley voted against sending a proposed constitutional amendment to the ballot asking voters to replace Save Our Homes assessment caps with bigger homestead exemptions. Under the proposal, which passed without a Democratic vote, the first $200,000 of value would get a 75 percent exemption, then property values between $300,000 and $500,000 would get an additional 15 percent exemption. Homes valued at $500,000 and up would get a maximum exemption of $195,000. Democrats argued that the tax cuts could harm funding for education and for police and fire protection. Ausley did vote to schedule the special election for the proposal on Jan. 29, 2008. She also voted for a proposal to roll back the tax bases for cities, counties and special taxing districts. Ultimately, the Republican-led constitutional proposal was tossed off the ballot by a judge who ruled the amendment was confusing. So legislators returned to deal with the constitutional proposal that October. Ausley was just one of two House members to vote against a House plan to raise the homestead exemption, create a cap on assessment increases for non-homesteaded property, provide additional exemptions for low-income seniors, and allow people to move and keep some of their homestead tax cap. According to the Tallahassee Democrat, Ausley complained that the ""cuts would devastate poor and rural counties."" That proposal never became law or was put to voters either. Instead, the final tax reform product in 2007 -- what became known as Amendment 1 on January 2008 ballots -- passed the House 97-18 and the Senate 35-4. Ausley again voted against the measure. Amendment 1 passed with 64 percent of the vote. Taxes on seniors Ausley didn't push for increased taxes on seniors. Instead, she opposed cutting and eliminating the state's intangible tax. This is ground PolitiFact Florida already has covered in a claim against Ausley from the Republican Party of Florida. Here are the details. The intangible tax, which was repealed by the Legislature in 2006, was a state tax paid on the value of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds and unsecured notes. Savings accounts, pension funds, certificates of deposit and 401(k)s were not subject to the tax. The tax was paid mostly by middle- and upper-income Floridians who had those types of investments. On several occasions, Ausley voted against repealing, or making cuts to the intangible tax. In 2001, she did vote for a more modest cut than Republicans were proposing. Democrats argued that the benefit of the cut was largely to the wealthy and the loss of state revenue would hurt programs for the poor. The tax, of course, didn't apply only to seniors. It applied to anyone who had those types of investments. And it didn't apply to things that would be traditionally considered retirement funds like a 401(k) or a pension. Summary This fact check centers on Atwater's claim that ""Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors."" First, we want to mention that Atwater's ad also claims that Ausley ""wants total control of our money."" That's incendiary and far-reaching rhetoric that cannot be supported by examining Ausley's statements or voting history. You should ignore the line. What is true, though, is that Ausley voted against measures to create a gas tax holiday for one month in 2004, voted against sweeping property tax cuts in 2007 and voted against eliminating a state tax on investments. That makes the ""taxes on seniors"" immediately deceptive because the intangible tax isn't a tax on seniors specifically. Something else that has us scratching our heads more, though. Atwater says Ausley was ""pushing"" these taxes. But was she? Time to take out the dictionary. There are several definitions of the word push, but in this context we find a couple that make sense - ""To cause to increase,"" and ""To press forward energetically against opposition."" Ausley didn't vote to cause those taxes to increase, nor did she press forward energetically with the taxes. She voted against cutting them. We find this claim False.",None,Jeff Atwater,None,None,None,2010-10-14T17:45:21,2010-10-13,['None']
109,pomt-04924,"""The president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for our country.""",false,/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jul/31/kelly-ayotte/kelly-ayotte-parrots-dubunked-romney-talking-point/,"Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, rumored to be one of Mitt Romney’s choice running mates for his 2012 presidential campaign, made her rounds on the National media circuit this weekend criticizing the President while touting the former Massachusetts governor, this time during CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. When host Candy Crowley highlighted Romney’s foreign faux pas while traveling abroad over the weekend, Ayotte was quick to shift the criticism onto President Barack Obama’s foreign policy speeches to show why she feels Romney would better serve as Commander in Chief. ""I can tell you that certainly, Mitt Romney is going to be strong on America's exceptionalism and strong foreign policy for America and he won't go around and apologize for America,"" Ayotte said. ""Think about it. The president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for our country, and he's actually made us weaker around the world as opposed to stronger, and Mitt Romney will stand strong with our allies."" In the world of PolitiFact, Ayotte and Romney have campaign chemistry, at least when it comes to this claim; we’ve already fact checked Romney three times for saying Obama apologized for U.S. actions overseas. He’s earned a False and a Pants on Fire, not once, but twice. The concept that Obama has traveled the world apologizing is popular among some conservative websites, and since Ayotte put the claim back in the public spotlight, PolitiFact New Hampshire felt it was time to bring it before the Truth-O-Meter, again. What Obama said Romney first made the accusation about Obama’s apologies abroad in his book titled, ""No Apology,"" and later said Obama issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. For starters, as PolitiFact looked over Obama's remarks, we have noticed that Obama never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: ""sorry."" Merriam-Webster defines an apology as ""an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret."" PolitiFact read the Obama speeches Romney references and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together. But Since Ayotte cited the Cairo speech specifically, we’ll focus on that one. During a 6,000-word speech on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world in Cairo in 2009, Obama did get very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply ""move forward."" Here are his exact remarks: ""In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward."" Obama also praised America, saying ""The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world."" An Ayotte spokesman, reached Tuesday, stood by the claim that the president was apologetic, saying the President acknowledged what he considered to be several errors in U.S. foreign policy during his speech and then pledged to change course. ""President Obama is entitled to his opinion and Senator Ayotte is entitled to her opinion, which is that his address in Cairo amounted to an apology,"" Ayotte spokesman Jeff Grappone said. ""There are numerous ways to apologize for American foreign policy without actually using the word ‘sorry.’ In this case, Senator Ayotte and President Obama have a fundamental difference of opinion, which she expressed."" They cited several passages, including Obama’s comments about Iran, which they say amounted to the President apologizing for the United States. Here are the President’s statements from the speech they cited: • Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. • Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course. I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. • I know -- I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq. So let me be clear: No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other. • But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century -- and in too many Muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas. I'm emphasizing such investment within my own country. And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement. • More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. Did Obama apologize? PolitiFact sent Obama's remarks from each of the speeches that Romney cited, including the Cairo speech, to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing. • Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the website Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. ""Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect,"" she said. ""But a gesture of respect is not an apology."" • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing, which is not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower."" ""Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies,"" Gardiner said. ""It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership."" • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama was using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. ""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" Murphy said. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret."" • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words ""sorry"" or ""regret."" ""I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there,"" Bloom said. Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, PolitiFact has also compared Obama to his two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, in the earlier fact check. Our ruling While Obama's speeches have contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, those passages were typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries have erred as well. The same is true when zeroing in on Obama’s Cairo speech, when the President never included the words ""sorry,"" ""apologize,"" ""error,"" or even ""regret."" It’s incorrect for Romney, and now Ayotte, to portray any of these speeches as apologies. PolitiFact has regularly found Romney’s angle--that Obama’s trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries--to be a ridiculous charge. There’s a clear difference between changing policies and apologizing, and Obama didn’t do the latter. However, Romney charged that the President went on global apology tour, while Ayotte cited only one stop along that tour. Still, for parroting Romney’s repeatedly refuted claim, we give Ayotte a False. Note: Ayotte’s response was added to this item Tuesday evening after it was originally published.",None,Kelly Ayotte,None,None,None,2012-07-31T17:34:09,2012-07-29,['Cairo']

Barack Obama's proposal to leave a ""strike force"" of U.S. troops in the Middle East after a withdrawal from Iraq, Sen. John McCain belittled his potential rival for the White House, saying Obama had no expertise in the area of national security. ""I think somebody ought to ask what in the world (Obama's) talking about, especially since he has no experience or background at all in national security affairs,"" McCain said in an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe program. As a Vietnam war hero and senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has played a key role in most major debates on the war and the military, McCain might feel justified in delivering such a broad swipe. He's not the only candidate to go down this road; before bowing out of the race, former Democratic contender Joe Biden, the senior senator from Delaware, incorrectly said Obama hadn't passed any bills in the Senate. We ruled that statement False. McCain is exaggerating, too. In his three years in the Senate, Obama has dealt with substantial issues such as nuclear proliferation as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and also participated in debates on the Senate floor and within the Democratic caucus on the war strategy, proposed timetables for troop withdrawals and the U.S. response to the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. That national security experience might not match up to McCain's lengthy resume, but it's arguably more than George W. Bush brought to the White House after he was elected president in 2000. One of Obama's biggest legislative accomplishments in the national security arena came in 2006 when he helped write an exemption to the 1954 Atomic Energy Act allowing the United States to export to India civilian nuclear power technology, including nuclear fuel and reactors. The move was seen as cementing relations with an emerging power without endangering longstanding non-proliferation policies. Bush, in signing the bill in December 2006, praised it for ""lay(ing) the foundation for a new strategic partnership between our two nations that will help ease India's demands for fossil fuels and ease pressure on global markets."" In 2005, Obama and then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., toured a weapons destruction facility in the Ukraine where the United States was taking the lead in a three-year NATO program to destroy small arms, shoulder missile launchers and other supplies often sought by terrorists. The pair later collaborated on an effort to triple spending for programs to counter the spread of conventional weapons, but the bill never made it to a Senate vote. In 2005, Obama also participated in a more parochial national security debate, arguing against the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's decision to move some operations at the Rock Island Arsenal in his home state of Illinois to military installations in Texas. It's true that Obama's freshman rank and committee assignments didn't throw him in the middle of the national security fray, and it's true that his background is no match for McCain's. But to say he has absolutely no national security background or experience is an overstatement. For this reason we rule McCain's statement to be False.",None,John McCain,None,None,None,2008-04-03T00:00:00,2008-04-03,['None']
111,pomt-10215,"""While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/09/chain-email/story-of-banned-books-is-murky/,"One of the most potent claims in an e-mail written by Wasilla, Alaska, resident Anne Kilkenny is that when Sarah Palin was mayor, she tried to have some books removed from the city library. Here's how the claim reads in Kilkenny's e-mail: ""While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed. City residents rallied to the defense of the City Librarian and against Palin's attempt at out-and-out censorship, so Palin backed down and withdrew her termination letter."" ( Read the entire e-mail for yourself here. ) The most definitive record for much of this issue comes from a Dec. 18, 1996, article in the Wasilla newspaper, the Frontiersman. In that story, Wasilla library director Mary Ellen Emmons (now Mary Ellen Baker) said that after Palin was elected mayor, she twice inquired about censoring library books. ""I'm not trying to suppress anyone's views,"" Emmons told the Frontiersman. ""But I told her (Palin) clearly, I will fight anyone who tries to dictate what books can go on the library shelves."" ""This is different than a normal book-selection procedure or a book-challenge policy,"" Emmons said. ""She was asking me how I would deal with her saying a book can't be in the library."" Palin told the Frontiersman that she had no particular books or other material in mind when she posed the questions to Emmons. In a written statement to the newspaper, Palin ""said she was only trying to get acquainted with her staff"" and that the question was ""rhetorical."" Also from the story: ""Emmons said Palin asked her on Oct. 28 if she would object to censorship, even if people were circling the library in protest about a book. 'I told her it would definitely be a problem the ACLU would take on then,' Emmons said. ""Asked who she thought might picket the library, Palin said Monday, 'Had no one in mind ... again, the issue was discussed in the context of a professional question being asked in regards to library policy.' "" In an interview with PolitiFact, Kilkenny said the issue also came up at a council meeting soon after Palin took office in 1996. Time has passed, Kilkenny said, and she can't remember the exact words, but she said Palin asked Emmons something like, ""What would your response be to my request to remove books from the library collection?"" ""I remember being shocked at the implication,"" Kilkenny said. She said that there was a long pause of silence, and that Emmons responded that books were selected in line with national criteria for a library its size. Kilkenny said she remembered Emmons concluded firmly: ""I would absolutely not comply with your request."" Kilkenny said Palin's request didn't sound rhetorical to her. The conversation between Palin and Emmons came the same week that Palin requested resignations from all the city department heads as a test of loyalty, the Frontiersman noted. Emmons, a popular librarian who was then president of the Alaska Library Association, did not resign. On Jan. 30, 1997, about six weeks after the story appeared, Palin told Emmons and the police chief that she was dismissing them. The next day, Palin changed her mind about Emmons and let her stay on. Emmons finally resigned in August 1999. ( See our ruling on the e-mail's claim about the police chief here. ) We can say for certain that no book was ever banned. Nor is there any record that Palin initiated a formal process to censor any books. June Pinell-Stephens, longtime chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Alaska Library Association, said she scoured the organization's archives and could find no record of any formal actions to ban books in Wasilla under Palin's tenure as mayor. That jibes with Wasilla Library records as well. ""We have no records of any books being 'banned or censored' ever,"" Wasilla Mayor Diane M. Keller said in a statement released about the issue. Keller told PolitiFact that the city hasn't been able to find any minutes to substantiate that the issue was ever raised by Palin at a City Council meeting. Nor does Keller, who was a council member at the time, recall any such conversations. Jeanne Troshynski, president of the Friends of Wasilla Library, said the last formal request to remove a book came in 2005, with the challenge of a book written by Jon Stewart of The Daily Show called America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction. That was three years after Palin left office as mayor. Wasilla records show the last formal challenge before that was in 1986 to Bumps in the Night, by Harvey Allard — well before Palin's tenure as mayor. In both cases, the challenges were denied and the books remained on the shelf. But Kilkenny's e-mail doesn't claim that Palin initiated a formal process to ban books. In fact, Kilkenny said she does not recall that Palin even mentioned specific books that she wanted banned. And Emmons, now Mary Ellen Baker, isn't talking. A message on her answering machine states: ""I have nothing to add to reports from that time. I do not want to discuss the matter. Please respect my privacy."" But the Frontiersman reporter who wrote that article in 1996 now says Emmons told him Palin did mention three books that she wanted removed from the shelves. Paul Stuart is semiretired, though he still occasionally contributes articles to a weekly paper, the Mountain Ear, in Conway, N.H., where he lives. Stuart told PolitiFact that in a conversation with Emmons after his article ran, she listed three titles. He said he could recall only two, and initially said they were I Told My Parents I'm Gay and I Asked My Sister. We looked for these titles; they don't appear to exist. ""Mary Ellen told me that Palin asked her directly to remove these books from the shelves,"" Stuart said. ""She refused."" Asked later if the first book could have been Pastor, I am Gay, a controversial book written by a pastor who lives just outside Wasilla, Stuart said that was it. Howard Bess, author of Pastor, I am Gay and former pastor of Church of the Covenant in nearby Palmer, recalls that his book challenging Christians to re-examine their ideas about and prejudices against gays and lesbians was not well received in Wasilla when it was published in 1995 — the year before Palin was elected mayor. Virtually every book store in Wasilla refused to sell it. Bess said he gave two copies to the Wasilla Library, but they quickly disappeared. So he donated more copies. The controversy over the book was part of the context of that time period, he said. ""Knowing Sarah's religious connections and the people involved, I would be surprised if my book was not one of those at issue,"" Bess said. ""But I don't know that for a fact."" ""I don't think anyone has the facts except Mary Ellen, and she ain't talking,"" Bess said. In addition to Kilkenny's e-mail, there is another one circulating widely with the subject line, ""The Books Sarah Palin tried to have banned."" It purports to be a list taken from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. ( Read it for yourself here. ) The 93 titles appear to be a generic list of frequently banned books. It was not part of the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. In fact, the Harry Potter series listed didn't even begin until 1998, two years after this list is alleged to have been generated. In short, the list is a fake. As for Kilkenny's claim, there is no proof that Palin tried to fire the librarian because she refused to consider removing books. In fact, Palin asked for the resignation of a handful of department heads to test their loyalty, according to reports at the time. The claim that Palin had specific books she wanted removed is also unsupported. Kilkenny herself said she does not recall that any titles were named by Palin at the time. Yes, a reporter provides a secondhand account 12 years later in which he says the librarian named books Palin wanted removed. But Stuart's recollection seems hazy (he didn't get the right title at first). The librarian isn't talking. There are no public records or meeting minutes to substantiate the claim. And no one else corroborates that Palin ever listed any titles. So we find no basis to find that part of the story true. But Palin did ask the librarian if she would consider removing books. Maybe it was posed as a rhetorical question as Palin says. But she asked. So we rule the statement Half True.",None,Chain email,None,None,None,2008-09-09T00:00:00,2008-08-31,"['Wasilla,_Alaska']"
112,pomt-07084,"In the Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire, none of the candidates mentioned the ""middle class"" or ""education.""",mostly false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/24/jay-carney/democrats-say-republican-presidential-candidates-d/,"To illustrate that the Republican presidential candidates are out of touch with ordinary Americans, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney cited two things that he said the candidates failed to mention during a two-hour CNN debate from New Hampshire: education and the middle class. Flying to Puerto Rico on Air Force One on June 14, 2011, Carney told reporters: ""I was struck by the fact that over the course of two hours, the phrase ‘middle class’ and the word ‘education’ did not pass anyone’s lips that I heard, which was striking to me because the middle class is obviously, to our mind, the primary focus of everything that we do in terms of the economic policies we pursue and the concerns we have. The middle class not only suffered tremendously during the great recession and is suffering as we emerge from it, but was under a great deal of pressure even prior to the recession. While incomes were growing rapidly under the previous administration and the economy was expanding, middle-class incomes were flat, stagnant, and even dropping. So that was one observation. ""And another is that . . . as the president talks about a lot, education could be the key, the defining element of whether or not the United States of America can compete globally in the 21st century -- compete and win. We think it’s a high, high priority. And I was struck by the absence of attention to that very key issue last night."" Carney's comment was a Democratic talking point on the day after the debate. The Democratic National Committee issued a Web video called ""What in the world are they talking about?"" that made the same point. So were Carney and the DNC right? We checked the debate transcript and found that Carney is technically correct that the words ""middle class"" and ""education"" did not appear in the 21,798-word debate. But it's important to look more broadly and see whether the candidates used other words with the same meaning. And indeed, we found the candidates made several references to middle-income Americans — they just used different words: ● Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty referred to America’s ""middle-income and modest-income people"" when WMUR political reporter Josh McElveen questioned him on his plan to ""right the housing ship."" ""Well, the first thing we need to do is get the government out of crony capitalism,"" Pawlenty said. ""We have this alliance between big government, big unions and certain big bailout businesses. And as Congressman Paul said a few minutes ago, we had politicians in Congress trying to micromanage the housing market, and they created a bubble and they created the mess. And now we have all these innocent bystanders, the good people of the United States of America, many middle-income and modest-income people, who've been devastated by this."" ● Pawlenty also mentioned ""blue-collar communities"" as he cited his upbringing in a ""meat packing"" and ""manufacturing"" town with a father who worked as a ""Teamster truck driver"" for much of his life. Speaking about a plan to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S., Pawlenty said, ""I understand what it's like to see the blue-collar communities and the struggles that they've had when manufacturing leaves. So I've seen that firsthand. But No. 1, we've got to have fair trade, and what's going on right now is not fair."" ● We counted three references to the middle class by former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who spoke of the ""broad middle of America."" ""I always am from Pennsylvania,"" Santorum said. ""We still make things there, and I represented the Steel Valley of Pittsburgh when I was in the Congress. And what I learned from growing up in Butler, Pa., steel town is that the broad middle of America was a broad middle of America when we had lots of manufacturing here because that's how the wealth from those who create the jobs get down. … We want to encourage people to set up jobs here in America. Take that R&D credit, make it permanent, take that innovation and then invest that money here to create that broad middle of America and have that wealth really trickle down."" On education, however, Carney was correct. We couldn't find any reference to the subject during the debate. Still, it's important to note that the candidates didn't choose the topics for questions. That was done by CNN host John King, New Hampshire journalists and voters. They chose not to ask about education. In fact, King started the debate reminding candidates of the rules, saying, ""We've also asked the candidates to answer the questions that they're asked, rather than the question they might have wished to be asked."" Our ruling Carney was technically correct that education and the middle class were not mentioned in the debate. But several times candidates made references to middle-income people using other terms. And they never got asked about education. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",None,Jay Carney,None,None,None,2011-06-24T15:03:26,2011-06-14,['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
113,pomt-13425,"""We had the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine come into a Republican primary to try and rig the election by spending $1 million against me in the last couple of days.""",mostly true,/missouri/statements/2016/sep/21/eric-greitens/greitens-claim-democrats-investing-primary-checks-/,"Republican gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens claims Democrats spent $1 million against him just before the August primary election. On an Aug. 11 Fox & Friends appearance, Greitens said, ""We had the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine come into a Republican primary to try and rig the election by spending $1 million against me in the last couple of days."" That number stood out, so we decided to investigate the claim. We reached out to Greitens' campaign staff for more information. Parker Briden, a campaign spokesman, said Greitens was referring to television attack ads aired against Greitens right before the primary. Campaign finance records Briden referred us to Missouri campaign finance reports filed by the Chris Koster campaign detailing contributions from Jobs and Opportunity, a political action committee. Koster won the Democratic primary for governor and will square off against Greitens in the general election in November. Beginning two weeks before the Aug. 8 primary, the PAC made four ""in-kind"" contributions — contributions of goods and services and not cash — to Koster for Missouri, Koster's campaign. The in-kind contributions carried a total valuation of over $1 million, according to the reports filed by the Koster with the Missouri Ethics Commission. The largest contribution was reported as $713,082, made on July 29. The same week, two other contributions were made — one valued at $112,560, and another for $150,080. On Aug. 5, three days before the election, the committee made a final contribution valued at $25,710.82. After the donations were made, the Greitens campaign issued a press release titled ""Koster Caught in Conspiracy to Hijack Republican Primary."" ""This is an attempt by national Democrats to steal an election in Missouri through meddling in the Republican primary,"" the release read. Attack ad The reported contributions coincided with a series of television ads attacking Greitens that aired in the five days before the primary. A group called Jobs and Opportunity is credited for paying for the ad. A YouTube video of the ad was posted on July 29, about a week before the primary. According to Koster's campaign finance expenditures, his campaign normally pays between $500,000 and $700,000 for media advertising. No other single campaign expenditure comes close to that amount. That puts the PAC's contribution in perspective — it's unlikely a $1 million in-kind contribution would buy anything else. The ad lambastes Greitens for accepting a separate $1 million contribution from Michael Goguen, a California-based tech financier. Goguen is the subject of a pending civil lawsuit with a woman who has accused him of sexual abuse. ""While others returned his money, Greitens says he's honored to take it,"" the ad's narrator says. Greitens is right: the Democratic Governors Association is behind money given to his Democratic opponent. The Washington, D.C. address for Jobs and Opportunity that the Koster campaign reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission is also the address for the Democratic Governors Association. A week before the election, Jobs and Opportunity made a $1 million in-kind contribution to Koster, which coincided with a TV ad attacking Greitens. Although the political action committee is unaffiliated with Koster’s campaign, Koster's campaign had some knowledge of the ad before it aired, since the in-kind contribution was listed on Koster's campaign finance report. PACs that act independently from a candidate do not have to report contributions to that candidate's campaign, said James Thomas, the campaign treasurer for Catherine Hanaway, who was a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the primary. But when the PAC is in contact with the candidate, related contributions need to be reported. For example, the PAC could have discussed when the ad's content or when it would be aired with Koster's campaign, Thomas said. Since Missouri has no limits on campaign contributions, it's okay that the PAC talked to Koster's campaign. It would be a different story if this were a federal election, though, Thomas said. Federal PACs can only contribute $5,000 to a candidate, so Jobs and Opportunity’s $1 million in-kind contribution would be illegal. On July 31, Greitens released an ad in response to the PAC's ad. In the ad, which has since drawn national attention, Greitens fires rounds of a machine gun into an open field. ""Eric Greitens is under attack from Obama's Democrat machine,"" the narrator of the ad says. ""When he fights back, he brings out the big guns."" After the primary, Greitens said no other Democratic groups launched attack ads against any other Republican gubernatorial candidate, according to the Associated Press. We also asked Austin Chambers, Greitens' campaign manager, why Greitens repeatedly cited President Barack Obama's involvement in the ad buy. Chambers said the company the PAC hired to purchase the airtime for the ad is the same Obama has used for his ads. The company, named GMMB, produced ads for Obama during both of his presidential campaigns. And though Koster's donations were big, they were legal, despite Greitens' press release connoting Koster's involvement in illegal activity. Koster's campaign directed all questions to the spokesman for the PAC. Marvin Overby, an MU political science professor, said large donations like the PAC's are common before an election. ""This happens a lot. It's just part of the rough and tumble of politics,"" he said. ""I'm not sure the Greitens' campaign wouldn't have done the same thing."" Our ruling Greitens said the Democratic Governors Association and ""the Obama political machine"" spent $1 million against him leading up to the primary election. A PAC with the same address as the Democratic Governors Association made four in-kind contributions totaling that amount in the weeks leading up to the election. And though both Obama and the PAC hired the same company to work on their ads, there's no evidence to support Greiten's statement that the ""Obama political machine"" colluded with the PAC.

Dan Donovan for re-election, citing the Staten Island Republican’s support for tax cuts. In a tweet, Trump praised Donovan’s record on taxes, the military and other issues. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com ""There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!"" Trump tweeted. Donovan faces a challenge from former Rep. Michael Grimm, who held the seat before Donovan won a 2015 special election. Grimm resigned from Congress after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion charges in 2014. Donovan trailed Grimm by 10 points in a poll conducted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in April. Trump’s tweet could help narrow that gap. But is Trump right about Donovan’s record on tax cuts? Recent tax cuts A spokesperson for Trump did not get back to us with information supporting his claim, so we can't say for sure what he was talking about in his endorsement. A search on Twitter shows Trump tweeted about tax cuts four other times in May. Each of those tweets referred to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the federal tax law passed last year designed to lower taxes for the middle class and give major breaks to corporations and wealthy earners. Donovan was one of only 13 Republicans in the House that actually voted against the law. He and four other Republicans from New York state were against a part of the bill that limited the deductibility of state and local taxes. Residents were previously allowed to deduct an unlimited amount of those taxes. The new law caps that deduction at $10,000. ""Capping this deduction – which has been a part of the U.S. tax code since 1913 – will increase taxes and harm the already-unaffordable housing market in my district,"" Donovan said in a statement at the time. ""With the state and local tax deduction nearly eliminated, this tax bill doesn't equal relief for far too many New Yorkers."" Past tax cuts Congress has passed other tax cuts since Donovan took office. He voted in favor of an omnibus spending bill that included more than $600 billion in tax relief in 2015. The bill permanently extended several tax breaks enacted during the Great Recession that were set to expire in 2017. The enhanced child tax credit, for example, gave couples without a tax liability a larger tax refund based on the number of children they have. The 2017 tax law allows an even larger refund for those families with the credit. The 2015 law also extended a $2,500 tax credit for low- and middle-income filers attending their first four years of college. That credit was not changed in the 2017 law. Other provisions of the 2015 law expanded another tax credit for low- and middle-income workers with children, allowed teachers to deduct up to $250 in school-related expenses, and extended other tax breaks Donovan also voted for a budget bill earlier this year that included more tax extenders for filers, and a bill in 2017 that gave extra tax relief to victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Our ruling Trump said Donovan ""voted for Tax Cuts."" That's actually true. Donovan has voted for tax cuts in the past, though he was against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year. Trump's other tweets about tax cuts refer to that law, but we can't assume what Trump was talking about. That makes Trump’s statement accurate, but it required additional information.

And near the top of any list of toss-up races is California’s 45th Congressional District, an Orange County seat held by incumbent Republican Rep. Mimi Walters. Hillary Clinton carried the district in 2016 by five percentage points, and Democrats have nominated UC Irvine law professor Katie Porter to challenge Walters this November. One big issue in the race: President Donald Trump's 2017 tax overhaul. While the tax bill, which Walters supported, cut taxes for many, Porter claimed in a recent television ad that it will actually raise taxes on ""middle-class Californians."" ""Mimi Walters votes with Donald Trump 99 percent of the time and Mimi Walters raised taxes on middle-class Californians,"" Porter’s ad claims. Here, we’re focusing on Porter’s claim that Walters ""raised taxes on middle-class Californians."" Porter campaign manager Erica Kwiatkowski said the claim stems from Walters’ vote for the Trump tax bill. What the federal tax bill means for California The tax bill, signed into law by Trump in December 2017, cuts corporate taxes across as well as income taxes for many Americans. But residents in higher-tax states like California will be hurt by changes to the state and local tax deduction. Previously, California residents could deduct the amount they pay in state and local taxes from their federal tax bill. As part of the 2017 tax bill, deductions will be capped at $10,000. The provision is set to end after 2025. About 6.1 million Californians filed for the deduction in 2015, reducing their federal tax income by an average of $18,438, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. A report prepared by the Government Finance Officers Association, a group made up of government finance officers, shows similar numbers. The average deduction in California, New York and New Jersey are all over $17,000. If the state and local tax deduction were eliminated, ""an average taxpayer in New York who currently itemizes SALT (state and local tax) would face a tax increase of almost $5,500."" That figure wouldn’t be far off for a decent chunk of Californians. How it affects middle-class Californians First, the 1 million California taxpayers who may have to shell out more tax money next year, as seen in Porter’s ad, are not all middle class. The Sacramento Bee reported that while Californians will lose a collective $12 billion because the new law caps the state and local tax deduction, the lion’s share of that money will be paid by wealthy residents earning more than $1 million a year, with 43,000 of them paying a combined $9 billion. Still, some middle-class California families are predicted to pay more, too, according to an analysis by the state’s Franchise Tax Board. The board has been releasing reports on the tax bill in waves since it was signed into law in December. Notably, the tax board found that while most Californians should see a tax cut, about 751,000 households with incomes under $250,000 will likely owe more tax. Taken together, these taxpayers are estimated to owe an extra $1.1 billion. Regardless, it’s still hard to tell how it will affect each family as every tax return is different. And in a state with more than 39 million people, many middle-class Californians will see a tax cut — not an increase. ""In general, tax situations are unique for everyone, and it's difficult to assess a broad-ranging effect on future years, without having specific information about a person's return,"" a spokesperson for the tax board told PolitiFact. The Los Angeles Times also reported that Walters spent weeks pushing House leaders to alter the bill to lower the burden on her constituents before deciding to support it. She told the organization that she believes the ""changes to deductions"" and ""tweaks to the income ranges"" would mean a tax cut for her constituents. ""I campaigned on tax reform. I’ve always been a big proponent that we need to have tax reform in this country, and I think we have a very good package that we are presenting to the American people,"" she told the Times. It is worth noting that Walters’ Republican counterparts in nearby districts, Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Darrell Issa, both voted against the measure. Our ruling Porter’s ad says, ""Mimi Walters raised taxes on middle-class Californians."" That's misleading. While a provision in the tax bill will result in tax increases for some middle-class Californians, it won't for many more. The ad ignores all that context, along with the fact that lion's share of the tax increases Porter is talking about will be paid for by wealthy Californians. Porter's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

116,pomt-05716,"Says pension contributions under Gov. Chris Christie would represent ""75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010. That's right, in 15 years, total state contribution was only $2.1 billion.""",false,/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/07/gary-chiusano/christies-pension-contributions-would-represent-75/,"After just two years of making contributions to the state’s pension funds, Gov. Chris Christie apparently will be closing in on the total amount contributed by his five predecessors during a 15-year period. Well, that’s at least what one state assemblyman claimed in a recent TV appearance. With a combined pension contribution of nearly $1.6 billion over two fiscal years, Christie is on track to contribute 75 percent of the total state contribution made between 1995 and 2010, according to state Assemblyman Gary Chiusano (R-Sussex). Chiusano made that claim during a Feb. 26 interview on My9 News’ ""New Jersey Now,"" when he appeared with Assemblyman Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson). The week before, the Republican governor unveiled his fiscal year 2013 budget, which includes a nearly $1.1 billion pension contribution. ""Assemblyman Prieto is correct in terms of us funding the pensions by $1.1 billion, actually. And combine that with the contribution last year, the total…contribution by this Legislature and this governor is $1.6 billion,"" Chiusano told host Brenda Blackmon. ""Brenda, that's 75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010,"" Chiusano continued. ""That's right, in 15 years, total state contribution was only $2.1 billion."" PolitiFact New Jersey found that Chiusano needs to check his math, because he’s off by about $1.3 billion. Chiusano acknowledged in an e-mail that he mistakenly used the contributions made by former Gov. Jon Corzine to represent all of the contributions during that 15-year period. ""You are correct. The figure I was using as a Grand Total was in fact a Sub Total,"" Chiusano told us. ""The corrected statement in the future will be that Christie's total contributions to date will be 45.65% of the total contributed in 15 years of $3.4 billion. Thanks for catching that."" Let’s explain how the pension payments break down. The governor’s fiscal year 2013 budget summary includes a page detailing pension contributions from fiscal year 1995 under then-Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to Christie’s proposed payment for fiscal year 2013. According to that page, the combined state contribution between fiscal years 1995 and 2010 was about $3.4 billion -- not the $2.1 billion cited by Chiusano. Here’s the pension payments by governor: Governor Fiscal Years Total Pension Contribution Christine Todd Whitman (R) 1995-2001 $963,934,000 Donald DiFrancesco (R) 2002 $563,000 Jim McGreevey (D) 2003-2005 $101,424,000 Richard Codey (D) 2006 $165,026,000 Jon Corzine (D) 2007-2010 $2,175,596,000 All Five Governors 1995-2010 $3,406,543,000 Between payments in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, Christie’s total pension contribution would be $1,555,237,000, according to the budget summary. Based on that figure, Christie’s total contribution would represent about 45 percent of the total payment made between 1995 and 2010. That’s 30 percentage points less than the 75 percent claimed by Chiusano. Our ruling In a TV interview, Chiusano claimed that Christie’s total pension contribution would represent ""75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010. That's right, in 15 years, total state contribution was only $2.1 billion."" But according to the state Treasury Department, Christie’s total payment of nearly $1.6 billion would represent about 45 percent of the roughly $3.4 billion contributed between 1995 and 2010.

117,pomt-13639,"""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-michigan-job-losses-coal-/,"During an economic address at the Detroit Economic Club, Donald Trump tailored some of his statistics to the local audience. ""As a result of recent Obama EPA actions, coal-fired plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions, making them non-competitive in many cases,"" Trump said. ""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" Trump has often criticized efforts by the Obama administration -- and those who find climate change to be a serious concern -- to wean the United States from fossil fuels by tightening federal environmental regulation of coal-fired power plants. Here, we’ll take a look at the second part of Trump’s statement: ""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" This assertion initially caught our eye because we’d never thought of Michigan as one of the premier coal-producing states. Our suspicion was correct: According to the National Mining Association, Michigan is not on the list of 26 states that currently produce any amount of coal. Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of workers engaged in any type of mining in Michigan over the last decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000, making it essentially impossible to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in that sector. And as the Washington Examiner has noted, Michigan has fewer than 20,000 people working in the electricity generation sector today. So the scale of the job losses Trump cites seem, at least at first blush, to be unlikely. So what was Trump trying to say? The prepared version of his speech includes a footnote that points to a news release from the National Mining Association published almost five years ago, on Sept. 7, 2011. Here are some excerpts from that news release, which criticized ""Beyond Coal,"" a campaign against coal-fired power plants coordinated by the environmental group the Sierra Club and cited a study the group released: ""The destructive impact of the ‘Beyond Coal’ campaign is most clearly evident in the following 10 states where power plants blocked by the club represent the highest number of potential jobs (construction and permanent) foregone: Illinois (126,612), Texas (122,065), Montana (114,102), Nevada (75,194), Florida (75,055), Ohio (70,371), Colorado (55,620), Michigan (53,587), Oklahoma (42,581) and Kentucky (38,824)."" In response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, Andrew Wheeler, an energy adviser to the Trump campaign, also pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis that found that 10 delayed or canceled projects in Michigan -- most of them coal-fired plants -- would have created 56,000 jobs up front had they been built. Between the 53,000 jobs cited by the National Mining Association and the 56,000 jobs cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Wheeler said, ""it is obvious that the ‘over 50,000 jobs’ cited by Mr. Trump is accurate."" But just because a campaign is able to footnote a specific number doesn’t mean that the number is meaningful, or as fully contextualized as it ought to be. Here are a few important things to know about this number. • The number refers to ""potential"" jobs lost, not actual jobs lost. This is an important point that would not be obvious from the way Trump phrased his statement. By leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost, Trump’s statistic invites a degree of outrage that isn’t warranted. And there are good reasons to be cautious about future job projections, especially when they have been framed so broadly as to include vendors to the industry, rail transport, ports and machinery manufacturers. Any job projections of this sort are subject to rosy estimates -- especially if a group has a vested interest in the issue. In making an argument to the public, all groups will put forward their most favorable case. Trey Pollard, the national press secretary for the Sierra Club -- which has its own dog in the fight -- said the number of plants being counted by the mining association are essentially ""the coal industry’s wildest dreams"" -- a reflection of circumstances in which they can build coal plants ""in any community they want to."" • The number doesn’t reflect that coal is increasingly being replaced by natural gas. Trump’s decision to use this number tells only part of the story of how the electricity sector has been developing. In recent years, according to federal statistics, coal has been losing ground to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy when it comes to electricity generation. A July 2016 analysis by Sam Evans of the School of Business and Economics at King University in Bristol, Tenn., found that environmental regulation has been a factor in this switch, but a ""secondary"" one. ""The recent decline in the generation share of coal, and the concurrent rise in the share of natural gas, was mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices that have made natural gas generation more economically attractive,"" Evans wrote. • This isn’t just about Obama or Clinton. Trump ignores that much of the impetus in Michigan for switching away from coal has come from the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, and from utilities themselves. Snyder has generally continued his support for steps to shift away from coal that began under his Democratic predecessor as governor, Jennifer Granholm. In 2015, Snyder said at an energy conference that ""now is the time to look at a long-term transition away from coal,"" adding that because of the state’s natural gas infrastructure, ""we're well positioned to actually have a fair amount of that coal demand go to natural gas."" And Gerry Anderson, the chairman and CEO of DTE Energy, an electric utility that serves more than 2 million customers in the state, has written that ""we plan to retire older, less efficient coal plants and build new, cleaner natural gas power plants over the next decade."" Our ruling Trump said that ""the Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" However, this claim is problematic on several levels. While the number matches one projection of how many potential jobs could be lost from the blockage of coal-fired plants, there’s a difference between actual jobs lost and potential future jobs lost. And the number cited -- an impossible-to-confirm projection based on broadly construed calculations released by a pro-coal group -- should be taken with a big grain of salt. Trump also ignores that market forces, not just environmental regulations, have driven many of the job losses in the coal sector, and he also ignores that Michigan Republican officials and utilities themselves -- not just the Obama administration -- have pushed the switch away from coal.

118,pomt-07313,"The Massachusetts health care plan is ""wildly unpopular"" among state residents.",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/16/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-says-massachusetts-health-plan-wild/,"On the May 12, 2011, edition of the Fox News Channel's’ O’Reilly Factor, host Bill O’Reilly and conservative commentator Laura Ingraham discussed a speech on health care given earlier that day by possible Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Romney’s speech was designed to draw distinctions between the Massachusetts health care plan passed when he was governor and the national health care law signed in 2010. In a separate item, we analyzed whether Romney was justified in calling the national law a ""government takeover."" Here, we’ll look at a comment Ingraham made regarding in-state public opinion about the Massachusetts plan. ""Look, I like Mitt Romney,"" Ingraham said. ""I think he's a really smart guy, and I think he would be a good president. ... On this, I don't get it, though, Bill. I mean, costs have gone up. It's wildly unpopular."" We wondered whether the Massachusetts system was in fact ""wildly unpopular"" with Bay State residents. We found two polls that shed light on this question to one degree or another. One was conducted in early April 2011 by Suffolk University of 500 Massachusetts residents. In response to the question, ""Do you think health care in Massachusetts is working?"" the poll found that 38 percent said yes, 49 percent said no, and 13 percent were undecided. This would seem to provide a measure of support for Ingraham’s claim. However, the question was phrased more broadly than Ingraham’s claim because it referred to ""health care in Masschusetts,"" which could include factors well beyond the state health plan, such as their own personal experiences with the specific doctors, hospitals and pharmacists they use. And even if the results were a direct commentary on support for the Massachusetts system, a split of 38 percent in favor and 49 percent against doesn’t indicate the state health care law is ""wildly unpopular,"" as Ingraham said. Unpopular, perhaps, but not necessarily ""wildly"" so. A more appropriate yardstick for measuring the plan’s popularity is a survey taken by the Harvard School of Public Health with the Boston Globe in mid September 2009. Here are two questions that most directly address Ingraham’s claim. Both were asked of the 467 respondents who told the pollsters that they were aware of the law: Given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law? Support: 59 percent Oppose: 28 percent Don’t Know: 13 percent Do you think the Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform Law should be repealed, continued as the law currently stands, or continued but with some changes made? Repealed: 11 percent Continued as the law currently stands: 22 percent Continued but with some changes made: 57 percent Don’t know: 10 percent The first question found residents support the law by more than a two-to-one margin. The second demonstrated that residents were not entirely satisfied with all of the law’s provisions, but it did show that support for outright repeal was low -- only 11 percent. A major caveat to the Harvard poll is that it was taken a year and a half ago, and sentiment may have changed since then. (Support for the law did drop by about 10 points compared to a 2008 Harvard poll.) Still, the Harvard data, despite being older, directly addresses Ingraham’s claim and indicates she was wrong. ""The statement about the plan being ‘wildly unpopular’ is unfounded given available polling data,"" said Robert Blendon, the Harvard researcher who helped do the poll. As for the newer poll, David Paleologos, who directed the poll in question, said the question has value, while acknowledging that it is broader in focus. ""It’s a snapshot of how people feel currently about Massachusetts health care,"" he said. ""I think that’s all we can garner from the question. … Unless questions are identically worded, a lot of the comparison is left open to one’s opinion."" On the advice of experts, we decided not to consider a recent customer satisfaction survey commissioned by the government agency that runs the state health insurance exchange created under the law. That study found that 84 percent of participants in the Commonwealth Care program rated it 4 or 5 on a five-point satisfaction scale, while only 4 percent said they were dissatisfied. Some news accounts mistakenly reported that this was a poll of all Massachusetts residents, but it wasn't, so we don't believe that it's a valid yardstick for assessing Ingraham's comment. We should note that an estimated 400,000 Massachusetts residents -- or only about 6 percent of people living in the state -- have secured health coverage as a direct result of the law, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. That has enabled 98.1 percent of Massachusetts residents to secure insurance -- the highest rate of any state. But that also means that the impact of the law has been indirect for more than 9 of 10 Massachusetts residents. Residents need to include a certificate of insurance when they file their taxes. More important, but less tangibly, they may find their insurance costs or their taxes going up due to how the law has reshaped the insurance market. And there is evidence that the increase in number of insured residents in the state has put pressure on primary care physicians, potentially leading to longer waits for service. Still, one Massachusetts political analyst, Tufts University political scientist Jeffrey Berry, said he didn’t detect a groundswell of opposition to the law among residents. ""Massachusetts voters, like voters everywhere, are unhappy with rising health care costs,"" Berry said. ""They see that in their insurance premiums -- every paycheck and every year, the rates go up. The reform for the uninsured passed during the Romney administration is, itself, largely invisible. People know it's there but don't know how it's working (or, unless they're on it, don't know how it works). There's very little press coverage of the program. In Massachusetts there is simply no controversy about the plan at this point. Most telling is that there is no real organized opposition to it and no effort in the state legislature to revise it."" Berry concludes that Ingraham’s ""wildly unpopular"" claim is ""wildly exaggerated."" Additional data from the Harvard poll supports Berry’s sense that it’s actually apathy -- rather than opposition -- that’s shaping views of the Massachusetts plan. The pollsters asked, ""Generally speaking, do you think this health insurance law is helping, hurting, or not having much of an impact on the quality of your health care, the cost of your health care and your ability to pay medical bills if you were to get sick."" Here are the results: • On quality, 23 percent said the law was ""helping,"" 14 percent said ""hurting,"" and 55 percent said it was ""not having much of an impact."" • On cost, 19 percent said it was helping, 24 percent said it was hurting and 47 percent said it wasn’t having much impact. • And on people’s ability to pay their medical bills, 24 percent said it was helping, 14 percent said it was hurting and 53 percent said it wasn’t making much difference. In other words, for each of these three issues, either a majority or a plurality of respondents said the law wasn’t having a significant impact. So where does this leave us? The Harvard data contradicts Ingraham’s argument, showing a fair amount of support for the law in general alongside feelings that it’s not doing much for them personally. The Suffolk poll is more recent, but the question asked is too broad to speak directly to Ingraham’s claim. And we couldn't find any other support for Ingraham's claim. So we rate Ingraham’s statement False.",None,Laura Ingraham,None,None,None,2011-05-16T14:47:26,2011-05-12,['Massachusetts']
119,pomt-09483,"Says he ""never"" donates to Democrats while Paul Workman ""contributes to Democrat Kirk Watson and other Democrats running against Republicans.""",half-true,/texas/statements/2010/feb/26/david-sewell/sewell-says-he-doesnt-donate-democrats-workman-con/,"Among three Republicans from southwest Travis County running for a seat in the Texas House, lawyer David Sewell calls himself ""the true conservative."" Need an indicator? In a campaign flier that hit mailboxes Feb. 22, he claims to ""never"" donate to Democrats while accusing his opponent, businessman Paul Workman, of padding Democratic warchests. ""Paul Workman contributes to Democrat Kirk Watson and other Democrats running against Republicans,"" the flier states. Them's fighting words. Does Sewell have it right? Let's start with the attack on Workman. Chad Wilbanks, a consultant for the Sewell campaign, pointed us to the Texas Ethics Commission's campaign finance reports that show Workman made contributions to state Sen. Kirk Watson, former state comptroller and U.S. Senate candidate John Sharp, former Texas House Speaker Pete Laney, and state Reps. Patrick Rose and Dawnna Dukes — all Democrats. Eric Bearse, a consultant for Workman's campaign, said that in each instance, Workman gave to Democrats who had ""no or nominal Republican opposition."" We looked at how much Workman donated to the aforementioned Democrats and which Republicans they were running against at the time. Watson: According to campaign finance reports, Workman donated $350 to his campaign before the 2006 November election. Watson was unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced Libertarian Robert ""Rock"" Howard in the general elections. No Republicans joined the race, which Watson won with 80 percent of the vote. Workman donated another $250 in 2007, less than a year into Watson's four-year term. Sharp: Workman donated $200 to his campaign in 2002 before the former state comptroller lost a November bid for lieutenant governor to Republican David Dewhurst. Rose: In 2006, Workman donated $100 to Rose's campaign. Rose won re-election to his House seat with 60 percent of the vote, swamping Republican Jim Neuhaus and Libertarian Tom Gleinser. In 2008, Workman gave $250 to Rose, who went on to beat Republican Matt Young and Gleinser with 59 percent of the vote. Dukes: Workman gave $100 to her campaign in 2006. She won re-election to her House seat after winning 85 percent of the vote against Independent Richard Wedeikes. Laney: Workman donated $250 to Laney's campaign in 2000 when Laney was unopposed in November for re-election to his House seat. Clearly, Workman made donations to Democrats — Sharp and Rose — who ran against Republicans. Next, let's check Sewell's claim that he never donated to Democrats. Our search of campaign finance reports filed with the ethics commission didn't find any donations to Democrats by Sewell. Yet we found that Stahl, Bernal & Davies, the law firm where Sewell is a partner, has contributed to Democrats, notably donating at least $5,000 to Democratic judges since Sewell started working at the firm as a clerk in 1998. Among other contributions during the past decade, the firm gave $800 before the 2000 general election to Democrat Woodie Jones, who lost to Republican David Puryear for the Third Court of Appeals. Before the 2008 election, the firm gave $750 to Jones who wound up besting Republican incumbent Ken Law for a seat on the Third Court of Appeals. Wilbanks said a portion of money that the firm's partners make each year is diverted to a company account from which each partner can independently spend money on political contributions in the firm's name. ""David does not support contributions to Democrats from the firm,"" said Wilbanks, his campaign consultant. We couldn't confirm Wilbanks' claim; the law firm declined to comment. Where does that leave us with the declarations in Sewell's mailer? Workman donated to Democratic candidates at least seven times leading up to general elections. Republicans were challenging the Workman-backed Democrats in three of the races. But Watson was never running against a Republican when he donated to Watson, as Sewell's claim implies. As for Sewell, we found no evidence that he has contributed to Democrats in his own name. Still, his firm has contributed to Democrats — running against Republicans — throughout Sewell's time there.

120,pomt-02023,"""We’ve got an average of 5,600 soldiers committing suicide. That’s about 20 a day.""",half-true,/georgia/statements/2014/jun/06/david-scott/not-all-veteran-suicides-can-be-tied-va-care/,"The controversy over lengthy delays at several of the nation’s Veterans Affairs medical facilities, including the Atlanta VA Medical Center in DeKalb County, has drawn significant criticism that those waits may have contributed to veterans’ deaths. One such voice is U.S. Rep. David Scott, a Democrat who represents portions of metro Atlanta. Scott was among lawmakers from both parties calling for Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki’s removal before the secretary resigned last Friday. In an interview with WABE just before that resignation, Scott tried to draw attention to the specific concern of mental health treatment in the scandal, which is compounded by allegations of efforts to cover up the delays. ""We’ve got an average of 5,600 soldiers committing suicide,"" Scott said. ""That’s about 20 a day."" Back-of-a-napkin math shows an immediate miscalculation. That annual rate of suicides would mean 15 daily suicides. But even with the math blunder, those daily rates seemed striking enough for PolitiFact to want to get to the bottom of the matter. A spokesman for the congressman said he was first drawn to the issue of mental health services for veterans after reading an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation last year. In his WABE interview, Scott blamed Shinseki in particular and the VA in general, saying, ""Nobody has been held accountable for all of those suicides."" The AJC probe of the VA facility in DeKalb found that more than 500 veterans were on a waiting list to receive mental health care in 2010. Sixteen attempted suicide. The Atlanta VA tried to solve the problem by referring more veterans to outside treatment. But by 2012, that decision created long waiting lists at those outside clinics, according to the AJC investigation. Last year, federal audits tied the deaths of three veterans in Atlanta to poor oversight by hospital staff, including some who had been referred to outside facilities. It was later revealed that a fourth veteran committed suicide in a VA hospital bathroom, prompting the replacement of both the head of the hospital and the mental health director. ""His big concern is for veterans who need help and can’t get it,"" said Scott’s chief of staff, Michael Andel. ""It’s about the delay, especially in getting care in mental health needs."" Andel referred us to an advocacy and support group, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, or IAVA, and a 2013 newspaper story about a VA study on suicide data. Both cite the daily estimate of 22 suicides by veterans. A closer look at the VA study, however, slightly complicates the issue. Based on the most extensive data ever collected by the VA on suicide, the report does calculate that 22 veterans die each day from suicide. But the estimate applies to all veterans, not soldiers who are on active or reserve services as Scott describes. The estimate relies on state data that identify the dead as veterans. It therefore includes those with or without any history of accessing VA care. A spokeswoman for the VA in Washington confirmed that the report also cites recent increases in the rates of suicide in the general population among middle-age adults between 35 and 64 years of age. The report found the majority of veteran suicides, about 70 percent, were by those age 50 and older. The report found that veterans make up a smaller percentage of the country’s suicides than a previous study in 2007. That suggests that an effort to improve suicide prevention programs at the VA had an effect, the report concludes, while also recommending additional improvements. ""VA must continue to provide a high level of care, and recognize that there is still much more work to do,"" according to the study’s executive summary. ""As long as Veterans die by suicide, we must continue to improve and provide even better services and care."" Andel said Scott’s statement was a part of the congressman’s effort to use the study’s findings to push for change. Scott supports a proposal from U.S. Rep. Larry Bucshon, a Republican from Indiana, to offer employment incentives to psychiatrists who agree to work for the VA to help with the shortage of services. The IAVA has lobbied for a separate bill, the Senate’s Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act. Among other things, it calls for recruiting more health care workers to the VA and Department of Defense and reviewing those agencies’ suicide prevention programs. ""We feel the system fails veterans, and that takes us to a point where unfortunately veterans are considering and committing suicide,"" said Nick McCormick, a legislative associate with the IAVA. ""We want to get that information out so there can be change."" To sum it up, though Scott is a little off on his math, he’s close enough on the daily rates for us. He has a point to drive home, that a lot of veterans are dying by their own hands. The problem is when he attempts to link the daily suicide rates of all military veterans, who may never have visited a VA center, with the current scandal. The study offers no evidence to back up the implication that blame lies with the VA on those deaths.

We downloaded the June 29 bid-request package from a site for state requisitions overseen by the state comptroller's office. The package shows the department was seeking bids to provide up to 300,000 stress ""relievers,"" which we're guessing are not balls because they're not round. Precisely, the package says, the agency sought bids to make ""promotional items with logo imprints to follow through on (the) TDA Food and Nutrition Texans Bring It Campaign,"" with the items to include grape-shaped stress relievers with ""Texans Bring It"" written on them or ""Eating Right,"" which would be made of polyurethane and be two inches high by three inches wide. The package says a second set of stress relievers, each one called ""Dumbbell,"" would be imprinted ""Texans Bring It"" and ""Exercise"" and be five inches high by 1.8 inches in diameter. A third stress reliever would be imprinted ""Book"" and ""Texans Bring It,"" according to the bid package, while other promotional items would include pencils, buttons and bumperstickers. The package says the bids were sought for various quantities, starting from 2,500 and topping out at 100,000 each. It electronically links to a Branders.com site showing what the agency wanted the stress relievers to look like (our interpretation: bunches of purple grapes). Is all this a real deal? To our inquiry, Bryan Black, Staples' spokesman, replied via e-mail: ""An invitation for bid was issued for these federally funded educational items to reduce the $5.8 billion avoidable health care expenditures, paid by taxpayers, associated with overweight and obesity health problems."" We followed up with Black, asking if it's accurate to conclude that up to 300,000 of the stress relievers are being purchased. We also wondered why the purchase was being made. Black said he'd limit his comment to his e-mailed statement. Surely the agency would pipe up if Gilbert got its purchase plans wrong.

122,pomt-11610,"""Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.""",mostly false,/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/26/scott-walker/checking-gov-walkers-claim-state-dot-ahead-game/,"Given the perpetual orange barrels and accompanying traffic delays on Milwaukee area highways, drivers could be forgiven if they pounded the steering wheel after a recent tweet from Gov. Scott Walker. ""Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation,"" the governor tweeted Dec. 18, 2017. Responses from the Twitterverse showed not everyone was in the same lane: ""Apparently the 94/45 interchange isn’t part of the state."" ""#WI: worst roads between the Rockies and Atlantic Ocean"" ""When is that zoo interchange supposed to be done again? 2018? 2019? 2020? . . . and counting."" Let’s give this one a spin. Walker’s evidence Walker communications director Tom Evenson noted the governor’s tweet directly followed the announcement that the State Highway 441 project in the Fox Valley will be finishing in 2019, a year ahead of the previous expected date. ""By combining projects on the WIS 441 project into a larger package for construction to bid, WisDOT anticipates more competitive bids, greater contractor efficiencies during construction and estimated saving of $9 million in project costs,"" Evenson said in an email. In addition, Evenson said, in April 2017, the governor announced that the Transportation Department freed up more than $100 million for additional projects to be advanced. This was a result, he said, of $65 million in savings over the course of the state fiscal year – due to lower gas prices and more competitive bids -- and an additional $38 million in available revenues to add to the Transportation Fund’s FY18 opening balance. Rebecca Kikkert, director of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Office of Public Affairs, pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to an April 13, 2017, state DOT announcement of the $38 million savings. ""With let savings, WisDOT is able to do additional projects and move scheduled projects ahead advancing them, which enables the completion date for these projects to move ahead and get completed sooner,"" Kikkert said in an email. Putting on the brakes Craig Thompson, executive director of the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin, a Madison-based group with a primary mission of outreach to the public, media, and decision-makers about the importance of an integrated transportation network, didn’t disagree with the evidence the Walker administration provided. However, Thompson cited a list of delayed projects, with several major ones among them: I-94 North-South between Kenosha and the Mitchell Interchange. Original scheduled completion: 2016. The completion date if the state receives an applied-for $246 million federal grant: 2021. The completion date without the federal grant: 2032. The state is still waiting to hear whether it will receive all, some or none of its request. I-94 East-West. The safety and congestion problems that prompted state transportation officials to plan the reconstruction and widening of I-94 between 16th and 70th streets in Milwaukee will not be dealt with now that the project has been abandoned. I-43 North-South (Silver Spring Drive. to Wis. 60), Glendale to Grafton - Milwaukee and Ozaukee counties. ""This project has been put on hold until further notice,"" according to an October 2015 announcement on the Wisconsin Department of Transportation website. I-94 between U.S. Highway 12 and State Highway 65 (St. Croix County). Work on the federally-designated truck route between the Twin Cities and St. Croix County was included in the 2017-'19 budget by lawmakers, but vetoed by Walker. To be sure, Walker’s team highlighted cases where -- once contracts have been issued -- work was completed earlier than expected, while Thompson noted delayed by broader funding issues. That said, Walker’s tweet did not make such a distinction clear. It was a broad claim. And -- as many of the Twitter responses indicated -- that’s how many people understood it. Ex-DOT secretary waved caution flag Then-DOT Secretary Mark Gottlieb told state lawmakers at a December 2016 hearing that the conditions of Wisconsin’s highways would worsen if funding trends continue. Under Walker’s budget at the time, 21 percent of Wisconsin’s highway system was projected to be in poor condition by 2018, he said. By 2027, that number would grow to 42 percent. Gottlieb had at times called for increasing taxes and fees to pay for highways. Walker has said he won’t raise gas taxes or vehicle fees unless an equivalent cut is made in other taxes. Gottlieb stepped down less than a month after he told lawmakers Wisconsin’s roads would worsen under Walker's plans. In September 2017, Walker signed the two-year, $76 billion budget. It borrows $402 million for transportation infrastructure, far less than included in recent budgets. The plan delays work on Highway 15 in Outagamie County and the north leg of the Zoo Interchange in Milwaukee County and puts off the reconstruction of I-94 between the Zoo and Marquette interchanges. The reduction in funding for interstates in southeast Wisconsin did a U-turn with the announcement of Foxconn locating in southeast Wisconsin. The state is pinning its hopes for the expanded freeway and related work on a $246.2 million federal grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation that would pay for about half the remaining cost. Our rating In a tweet, Walker said ""Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation."" A spokesman said Walker was referring to the early completion of the State Highway 441 project. But that was not specified in the tweet, and a wide range of other projects -- including major ones -- have been delayed.

123,pomt-04880,"""We have reduced funding for education the least. They've suffered the least cuts.""",half-true,/georgia/statements/2012/aug/08/fran-millar/did-lawmaker-get-good-grade-education-claim/,"For the first time in more than a decade, federal officials say, local school systems are contributing a larger percentage of public education funding than state governments. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the change in a news article and in its Get Schooled blog. One state lawmaker who plays a key role in education spending insisted that Georgia has not shirked its responsibility to its students. Education spending on children from kindergarten to the 12th grade has not dramatically declined in recent years, said Fran Millar, chairman of the Georgia Senate’s Education and Youth Committee. ""State revenue has gone down across the board,"" said Millar, a Republican state senator from Dunwoody. ""We have reduced funding for education the least. They’ve suffered the least cuts."" A PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to examine Millar’s statement. We, too, wondered whether Millar had correctly done his homework on this point. Has the state cut education spending to a lesser degree than other parts of state government? Millar told us he was referring to the percentage of spending on education, since it is such a large portion of state spending. Georgia’s current 12-month spending plan for k-12 education is about $7.2 billion. Georgia’s current fiscal year budget is about $19 billion. The state of Georgia manages its money on a 12-month timetable that begins July 1 and ends June 30. Millar added in an email and during a telephone interview to emphasize his point that the state had not made drastic cuts in education spending. ""It’s the least-touched major area"" in terms of cuts, Millar said. A few days after we started to examine Millar’s statement, the AJC reported that Gov. Nathan Deal and his budget staff have asked departments to come up with an additional $553 million in budget cuts by the 2014 budget cycle. The major portion of public school funding is exempt, the AJC reported. The senator said he was thinking about the years since Deal took office or Sonny Perdue’s last year as governor when he made his claim to the AJC. He said spending may have even increased during those years. We followed his suggestion of examining data from the Georgia Office of Planning and Budget to calculate recent state spending. PolitiFact Georgia looked at state spending since Deal took office in 2011 and from 2009, the year after the Great Recession began making an impact on state and local budgets. Here’s the breakdown on education spending in recent fiscal years: FY 2009: $8.20 billion. FY 2010: $6.59 billion. FY 2011: $7.07 billion. FY 2012: $6.97 billion. FY 2013: $7.17 billion. We found several state agencies with a smaller percentage of budget cuts. We considered what Millar said about the sizable chunk of money spent on k-12 education and focused on departments with large budgets. PolitiFact Georgia examined spending among the 10 departments with the largest current budgets, including four with current budgets greater than $1 billion. The K-12 budget is still about 20 times greater than technical colleges, the department with the 10th-largest budget. First, let’s look at spending since Deal took office. The Education Department’s budget rose by slightly more than 1 percent between FY 2011 and the current budget. Not a great deal of change there and not a decrease. What about the two most recently completed budget cycles? Between FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Education Department’s budget declined by slightly more than 1 percent. Of the 10 departments with the largest budgets, that was the smallest decrease. Five departments had budget increases, some as high as about 15 percent, as was the case for the Department of Community Health. Let’s examine spending since the recession. Since FY 2009, the Education Department’s budget declined by 12.5 percent. Of those with billion-dollar budgets, the Corrections Department was the only one with a smaller decrease, which was about 3 percent. Two other departments with large budgets -- transportation and technical colleges -- also had smaller percentage decreases of 8.5 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively. Again, there were some departments with budget increases. Millar countered that the state had no choice but to increase spending in some areas, such as the Department of Community Health, which oversees Georgia’s Medicaid program. State officials estimate they’ll have to spend about $4 billion in coming years to comply with the federal health care law. Millar maintained he had a good argument, despite the spending increases for departments and smaller budget cuts in other areas. ""On balance, if you look at the numbers, I still think it’s a fair statement,"" the senator said of his initial statement. So where does this leave us? Millar’s larger point is that the state has not made major cuts in education spending in comparison with other larger departments since Deal took office. The 1 percent cut in education spending between FY 2011 and FY 2012 was the smallest among 10 of Georgia’s largest departments and among those with billion-dollar budgets, which supports Millar’s quote in the AJC. Millar’s argument loses some steam when examining spending between FY 2009 and now. We found a few larger departments with smaller percentage cuts than education. Additionally, there are some large departments with budget increases. Millar’s quote is accurate on some levels, but there are some details we found that lower his grade-point average on this statement. We rate the senator’s claim Half True.",None,Fran Millar,None,None,None,2012-08-08T06:00:00,2012-07-25,['None']

But Herring said Obenshain was right on one point -- a charge that Herring had switched his stance on gay marriage. We rolled out the Flip-O-Meter to examine the extent of Herring’s change. Let’s journey back in time. In 2003, Herring unsuccessfully ran for the state Senate. He said marriage should be between a man and a woman, according to an Oct. 17 article that year in The Winchester Star. On Feb. 2, 2006, Herring was sworn in as a state senator after winning a special election in Loudoun County. Fifteen days later, he supported a resolution allowing Virginia voters to decide whether there should be a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Virginia law already defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But many referendum backers said the added constitutional amendment would shield the traditional marriage law from judicial tampering. Herring reiterated his support for the amendment during a Sept. 20, 2006, interview with Leesburg Today, saying it was consistent with Virginia’s existing marriage law. In November, the amendment was approved by 57 percent of voters. Herring sang a different tune this spring during his successful Democratic primary campaign for attorney general. On April 5, he released an ""Equality Agenda"" that said, ""Mark Herring believes that civil marriage is a fundamental right, and he supports marriage equality for same-gender couples."" Herring pledged to work ""to change the current law prohibiting such marriages."" Obenshain, a state senator from Harrisonburg since 2004, has been outspoken in his opposition to gay marriage. During a debate this June 15 with Herring, Obenshain said, ""I believe marriage is an institution to be entered into between a man and a woman. That’s an issue upon which Mark and I, until at least a few years ago, agreed."" Herring acknowledged that ""almost eight years ago"" he ""didn’t really feel comfortable"" about gay marriage. ""But since that time, I’ve done a lot of thinking about it,"" he said. ""I’ve talked to my friends, my constituents. I talked to co-workers; I talked to my family, including my children. And like millions of Americans and a lot of Virginians, I don’t believe that way anymore and I think it’s wrong. ""I don’t believe anybody should be treated as a second-class citizen and I don’t believe that the state should decide who you can and cannot marry. So I support marriage equality and as we work towards marriage equality, there are very specific things I, as attorney general, can do to help protect the rights of gay and lesbian Virginians.""

125,pomt-11030,"""The deficit ... is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly.""",pants on fire!,/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/02/larry-kudlow/larry-kudlow-wrong-about-deficits-falling-rapidly-/,"Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council for President Donald Trump, raised eyebrows when he said in a Fox Business Network interview that the nation’s deficit is falling on Trump’s watch. The economy under President Donald Trump, Kudlow said on June 29, ""is throwing out enormous amounts of new tax revenues. As the economy gears up, more people working, better jobs and careers -- those revenues come rolling in, and the deficit, which is one of the other criticisms (of Trump’s economic policy), is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly. Growth solves a lot of problems."" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As it happens, the deficit hasn’t come down to date -- which sparked a quick backlash on social media and prompted Kudlow to amend his remarks later that day. Kudlow told the Washington Post that ""the economy is so strong right now it’s going to produce lower deficits. I probably should have said future deficits."" However, that assertion is questionable as well. The most trusted source for future budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office, shows rising deficits for years into the future. The deficit so far under Trump In fiscal year 2015, when Barack Obama was president, the federal deficit was $438 billion. (A refresher: The deficit refers to federal revenues minus federal outlays. Each year’s deficit adds to the overall public debt.) In fiscal year 2016, which was also under Obama, the deficit rose to $585 billion. In fiscal year 2017, which was about two-thirds on Trump’s watch, the deficit rose to $665 billion. The deficit also rose as a percentage of the nation’s gross domestic product -- a way of comparing economic statistics across time. In fiscal year 2015, the deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP, rising to 3.2 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 and 3.5 percent in fiscal 2017. So on a full-year basis, Kudlow is wrong. He’s also wrong if you look at the first seven months of fiscal year 2018. According to the Treasury Department, the first seven months of the current fiscal year saw a deficit of $385 billion -- which is 12 percent higher than the first seven months of fiscal year 2017, when the deficit totaled $344 billion. The future course of the deficit As for the future, CBO finds no reason to expect the deficit to go down any time soon. For fiscal year 2018, CBO projects a deficit of $804 billion, rising each successive year to $981 billion in 2019, $1 trillion in 2020, $1.1 trillion in 2021, and $1.3 trillion in 2022. The deficit is also poised to increase as a percentage of GDP -- from 3.5 percent in 2017 to 4.0 in 2018 and eventually to 5.4 percent in 2022. Here’s the full chart from CBO’s most recent projections, released in April. Not only that, but CBO specifically cited the tax cut Trump backed and signed into law as a reason for spiraling deficits. ""The deficit that CBO now estimates for 2018 is $242 billion larger than the one that it projected for that year in June 2017,"" CBO wrote in its April report. ""Accounting for most of that difference is a $194 billion reduction in projected revenues, mainly because the 2017 tax act is expected to reduce collections of individual and corporate income taxes."" And the projections would be even worse if Congress doesn’t allow the recent round of tax cuts to expire. ""In that scenario, far larger deficits and much greater debt would result than in CBO’s baseline projections for the 2019–2028 period,"" CBO wrote. Our ruling Kudlow said, ""The deficit ... is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly."" After being criticized, he later clarified that he ""probably should have said future deficits."" Kudlow’s first formulation is wrong, and his revised version isn’t supported by the most widely trusted barometer -- projections by the CBO. Trump tax bill, which dramatically cut revenues, is a big reason why. The statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!

126,pomt-00064,Says Scott Walker ‘cut $800 million from our schools.’,mostly false,/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/02/tony-evers/democrat-tony-evers-misfires-education-spending-cl/,"Schools have been front and center throughout the race for Wisconsin governor, which pits the state schools superintendent against a Republican governor who famously took on teachers’ unions. In one volley, Democrat Tony Evers zeroed in on school spending under Gov. Scott Walker. ""Do you trust Scott Walker on education?"" asks the TV ad, released Sept. 25, 2018. ""He’s the politician who cut $800 million from our schools."" That’s very similar to an Evers claim we fact-checked in April -- that Walker ""has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools."" We rated that Mostly False. Does the reduced figure change things? State aid dollars short of $800 million figure Evers’ team said the number in the ad referred to cuts in 2011-’13, under Walker’s first budget. Though much of that funding has since been restored, Evers spokesman Sam Lau argued that doesn’t make the claim less true -- and doesn’t lessen the impact of the reduction. ""Each and every year of a student's education matters,"" Lau said in an email. ""Scott Walker's $800 million cuts to Wisconsin's public schools were devastating and continue to be felt today."" The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau provided numbers for our April fact check on this topic, and we’ll rely on those again. The chart below has a lot to take in, but we’ll focus on a couple numbers we’ve designated with asterisks. This looks at general purpose revenue (GPR) routed to schools, which includes per-pupil aid, equalization aid and other categorical aids. It starts with the 2010-’11 budget, the last one under Gov. Jim Doyle. That’s the baseline for the comparison. State fiscal year GPR school aids Change to prior year Change to 2010-’11 Cumulative change to 2010-’11 2010-’11 $5.27 billion 2011-’12 $4.85 billion -$426.5 million -$426.5 million -$426.5 million 2012-’13 $4.91 billion +$68.9 million -$357.6 million -$784.1 million* 2013-’14 $5.03 billion +$119.8 million -$237.8 million -$1.021 billion 2014-’15 $5.19 billion +$160.5 million -$77.3 million -$1.1 billion 2015-’16 $5.2 billion +$3 million -$74.3 million -$1.17 billion 2016-’17 $5.4 billion +$197.3 million +$123 million -$1.05 billion 2017-’18 $5.58 billion +$176.9 million +$299.9 million -$750.6 million 2018-’19 $5.84 billion +$267.1 million +$567 million -$183.6 million* The numbers do show a large drop when Walker first took office. The state had GPR school aid of $5.27 billion the last year under Doyle. The ""cuts"" Evers alleges come from comparing actual funding in the following two years to what funding would have been if it remained at that $5.27 billion level annually. The GPR school aids dropped by $426.5 million in 2011-’12 and then rose by $68.9 million in 2012-’13. Taken together, that reduced school aid by $784.1 million in the two-year budget. That’s in the ballpark of Evers’ claim, but it leaves out a lot of information. The missing pieces It’s critical to note the 2011-’12 funding reduction did not happen in isolation. Act 10, enacted in 2011, required public employees to pay more toward their pensions and decreased their collective bargaining power. That allowed schools to save money that would have gone toward employee pensions and to charge employees more for health insurance. When all districts were tallied in 2012, they spent $451.5 million less on employee benefits than in 2011, according to a study by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, now the Wisconsin Policy Forum. In 2013, benefits were $433.6 million less than in 2011. So across the two years where state funding was cut by nearly $800 million, school districts saved nearly $900 million in benefits. And that savings would be higher if you assume costs would have continued to rise from the 2011 levels (likely about 4.3 percent per year, according to the study). Another important factor: The Evers ad does not say it is referring to a funding change made more than five years ago in a single budget. Thus, viewers might assume school spending is $800 million less today than when Walker began. In reality, after the initial cuts, Walker has increased GPR school aids every year, hitting a high of $5.84 billion this year. That’s above the last year of Doyle’s term, though that doesn’t account for inflation. Those increases mean most of that $784 million in cuts has been returned to the budget. The right-hand column of the chart shows the difference between actual funding and what it would have been cumulatively if the schools budget remained $5.27 billion every year since 2011. That gap was more than $1 billion at one point but now is down to $183.6 million. Our rating In the ad, Evers claims Walker cut $800 million from schools. He did cut close to that ($784 million), in raw dollars in a single two-year budget. But that ignores changes made through Walker’s Act 10 that saved districts money. And the ad does not make clear that it’s referring only to cuts from 2011-’13, so viewers wouldn’t know that subsequent funding increases have made up most of that reduction. Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",None,Tony Evers,None,None,None,2018-11-02T12:00:00,2018-09-25,['None']
127,pomt-00256,"""Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country.""",half-true,/missouri/statements/2018/oct/04/renee-hoagenson/hoagenson-partially-right-missouris-poor-road-qual/,"Does Missouri have the worst roads in the Midwest? Renee Hoagenson, Democratic candidate for the 4th Congressional District, thinks Missouri lags behind neighboring states in road quality. In an Aug. 28 tweet, Hoagenson claimed that ""#Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country."" Hoagenson, who’s running against incumbent Republican Vicky Hartzler, argued the Trump administration’s plans to invest in infrastructure depends too much on privatization. Private companies would increase tolls and other costs for Missouri residents, Hoagenson claimed, and don’t create much union work. Experts we talked to agreed Missouri’s roads are severely underfunded. We’ve fact-checked other public officials’ comments about infrastructure quality, so we wanted to see where Missouri’s roads rank, and if they are as bad as Hoagenson says. Lots of road, little revenue Infrastructure experts told us there isn’t necessarily a formula for comparing state road quality. ""States vary slightly by how they define their pavement conditions,"" said Hussain Bahia, director of the Modified Asphalt Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, in an email. We wanted to explore the evidence anyway. Let’s start with Hoagenson’s tweet, which included a graphic listing the percentage of rural roads in poor condition by state, citing the TRIP 2017 Rural Roads Report. Rural roads make up 82 percent of the state’s total but cost less to maintain than major roadways. Hoagenson specified that Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Midwest region contains 12 states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Missouri had a Midwest region high of 21 percent of rural roads in poor condition in the report. Missouri and Washington tied for 11th nationwide. ""So it can be derived that we have some of the worst roads in the country,"" Hoagenson said in an email. The American Society of Civil Engineers issues a national infrastructure report card every four years and assigns letter grades on 16 infrastructure categories, including roads. There are some state-level report cards, but these report cards are based on data compiled by a volunteer state-level committee, which is overseen by a national committee, said Greg DiLoreto, chair of the society’s committee on America’s infrastructure. Not every state has such a committee in place, and DiLoreto made it clear it does not rank categories or states. Missouri received a C- for overall infrastructure in 2018 and a D+ for roads, with 24 percent of the state’s public roads considered to be in poor condition. Wisconsin, which did not receive a letter grade, was the worst in the Midwest, with 27 percent of its public roads in poor condition. Some of the least maintained roads in the nation are in the Northeast: 54 percent of public roads in Rhode Island are in poor condition; Connecticut’s roads are at 57 percent. Wisconsin was the only Midwestern state to edge Missouri in how much it costs motorists to drive on bad roads, also computed by the engineering society. Wisconsin’s figure is an extra $637 per motorist per year. Missouri’s $604 is second-highest in the region. Prompted by Hoagenson, we tried another way of looking at rural road quality: the road maintenance funding ratio. According to the Citizen’s Guide to Transportation, produced by the Missouri Department of Transportation, the state has the seventh-largest road system in the country at 33,856 miles, and it ranks 46th nationally in revenue per mile. To Hoagenson, that’s very lopsided. More roads, less maintenance makes sense as at least one measure, according to William Buttlar, chair of MU’s Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. In 2016, Missouri spent $13,379 per state-controlled mile on road maintenance disbursements and $2,024 on administrative disbursements, according to a report sponsored by the nonprofit, non-partisan Reason Foundation on state highway performance. Maintenance spending was 12th-lowest in the country and administrative spending second-lowest, next to Kentucky. In the Midwest, South Dakota and North Dakota had smaller maintenance disbursements than Missouri. One more measure that Buttlar pointed out was the International Roughness Index. The index measures the impact of a road’s roughness on a vehicle’s suspension; the lower the IRI, the better the road. Missouri’s IRI data show 19.58 percent of roads considered not ""good"" or ""acceptable,"" the third-highest proportion in the Midwest and the 26th-highest in the country.

Health care? Jobs? No — changes to student loans. Clinton got down into details in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech to nominate President Barack Obama for a second term. Student loan legislation under Obama, he said, ""lowers the cost of federal student loans."" ""And even more important,"" he told them, ""it gives students the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years."" He argued that would mean students wouldn’t have to drop out of college for fear they couldn’t repay their debt, and would be free to pursue jobs of ""modest income"" such as teaching, policing or practicing small-town medicine. We’re not checking those implications, but rather his characterization of the policy itself: Did Obama give students ""the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years""? Health care and education The president signed student loan legislation in March 2010 as part of a larger package that updated his attention-grabbing health care law. Previously, the government had paid private banks fees to provide federal loans to college students. The new law got rid of the middlemen, freeing up $68 billion over 11 years for Pell Grants and other programs. It also changed loan repayment terms. The government already had in place an ""income-based repayment plan"" that let students cap payments at 15 percent of their income above living expenses, and forgave remaining debt if they made those payments for 25 years. Under the new law, payments dropped to 10 percent, with debt forgiven after 20 years, or half that long for some public service workers such as teachers. The changes apply to new borrowers as of 2008 and haven’t kicked in yet, though they will by early next year, said Jason Delisle, an education budget expert at the New America Foundation who worked on the Republican staff of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. ‘Clear, fixed, low’ Now, while ""10 percent"" may seem to fit the bill for a clear, fixed, low portion of income, the repayment plan is actually a little more complicated than that — mostly in borrowers’ favor. That’s because the plan lets borrowers deduct 150 percent of the federal poverty threshold from their incomes before calculating the 10 percent payment. So, the rate for borrowers making less than $100,000 annually with a household size of one is actually less than 5 percent of total income, Delisle calculated, while it’s nearly 9 percent for higher income households. The payments are adjusted each year based on borrowers’ income and family size, requiring annual documentation — not quite as simple as Clinton made it sound. And borrowers may have to pay taxes on the amount of their debt canceled or forgiven. Our ruling Clinton said the president gave students ""the right to repay (federal) loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years."" That’s a reasonable characterization of a law the president signed in March 2010 that goes into effect by early next year for newer borrowers. But Clinton’s use of the word ""clear"" does oversimplify a somewhat more complicated reality that students will face an annually adjusted payment requiring paperwork on income and family size.

129,pomt-04225,"The ""error rates"" for the Fulton County elections department are ""well below the average.""",false,/georgia/statements/2012/nov/26/emma-darnell/no-evidence-found-back-fulton-commissioners-claim/,"Fulton County election officials have been the subject of much scrutiny from state officials and some news outlets for problems many voters had at the polls on Election Day. Annoyed by the criticism, County Commissioner Emma Darnell defended the staff at a recent meeting. ""I did some checking on my own to see what are the error rates for elections departments as large as this one. You’re well below the average,"" Darnell said during the County Commission’s meeting Nov. 7. PolitiFact Georgia was curious to determine whether Fulton’s error rates were below average, but we encountered a roadblock. Darnell said she respects the work of PolitiFact Georgia but wouldn’t discuss anything related to the election department. She complained about biased media coverage on the subject, particularly by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The commissioner did suggest we examine Fulton and compare it with other Georgia counties. Since Fulton is Georgia’s highest-populated county, we also thought a fair comparison would be to examine Fulton against other counties across the nation with similar populations. Without knowing exactly what the commissioner meant by ""error rates,"" we sought ways to examine mistakes by election officials at the polls. In Georgia, most voters cast their ballots on touch screens that are recorded on cards. Other states use other methods to record votes, so there is not a uniform way to measure errors. One uniform method to count votes, though, is provisional ballots, which appeared to be a problem for Fulton on Election Day. The greatest complaint about Fulton came from people who said they were told their names weren’t on the county’s voter rolls. In such cases, the person is given a provisional ballot and the county then works to verify that person is registered to vote. According to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, 9,575 provisional ballots were cast on Nov. 6 in Fulton. That was more than twice the total of provisional ballots cast in Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties combined, state data show. More than 100 people who tried to vote in Fulton have filed complaints to the state about the Nov. 6 election, the AJC reported. Fulton elections officials were still printing and delivering supplemental voter lists to precincts hours after the polls opened, the AJC has reported. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp called the situation a ""debacle."" Fulton officials have made some mistakes in recent years administering elections. In 2008, the county sent absentee ballots late to as many as 2,500 voters, the AJC reported at the time. The result: Some voters were unable to cast ballots in that year’s presidential election. In April 2009, state records show some Fulton election workers tossed thousands of voter registration cards in a Dumpster, violating proper procedure. They also failed to retain absentee ballot applications. The State Elections Board ordered Fulton to pay a $120,000 fine, plus costs associated with an investigation, a remedial plan and other penalties. Nearly 400,000 people voted in Fulton in the November 2012 general election, according to the Georgia secretary of state’s website. The county has 567,174 registered voters, state records show. Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, used 2008 federal elections data to compare the percentage of provisional ballots used by Fulton and nearly three dozen other U.S. counties with 400,000 to 800,000 voters. Other experts on elections also suggested we contact Stewart. In 2008, slightly more than 400,000 Fulton residents voted in the presidential election. About 4,100 ballots were cast using provisional ballots. That’s a 1 percent rate, which was about average among those 35 counties, Stewart said. Fulton’s 1 percent was twice as high as that in Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. There were nine smaller Georgia counties with a higher percentage of provisional ballots than Fulton, Stewart found. Those provisional ballots still needed to be checked to determine whether the vote should be counted. Nearly 1,500 of those provisional ballots in Fulton were rejected, Stewart said, which amounts to an acceptance rate of nearly 64 percent. The average acceptance rate for U.S. counties similar to Fulton was about the same, Stewart said. Stewart looked at the number of provisional ballots cast in Fulton in the Nov. 6 election and compared it with all the people who voted. ""If there are 11,000 provisional ballots this year out of 400,000 cast, that’s a 2.8 percent rate, which is quite a bit higher than 2008,"" Stewart said. Let’s recap. Fulton Commissioner Emma Darnell said the number of errors by the county’s elections staff was ""well below the average."" She declined to provide details to back up her claim. Research shows Fulton was in the middle among U.S. counties of comparable size when it came to provisional ballots rejected in 2008, the last presidential election. That year, twice as many provisional ballots were cast in Fulton than there were in some of Georgia’s largest counties. From the evidence available, the county’s recent history and the high number of provisional ballots cast in this month’s election, there’s not much evidence to back up Darnell’s claim that Fulton was ""well below the average.""

130,pomt-14814,"After the Texas cutoff of aid to women’s health care services including Planned Parenthood clinics, ""over 150,000… women lost the only health care they had. Our Medicaid birth rate shot up. It cost taxpayers over $130 million in one year alone in extra Medicaid birth costs.""",mostly false,/texas/statements/2015/nov/24/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-lawmakers-cut-150000-women-/,"Wendy Davis recalled recent Texas history while weighing in on the Republican push to defund Planned Parenthood. In a September 2015 interview on MSNBC’s ""The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,"" the former Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee and state senator responded to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida telling a Des Moines TV station he favors transferring all funding from Planned Parenthood to health centers that do not provide abortions. The funding shifts that Republicans seek nationally, Davis charged, will diminish women’s access to breast cancer screenings, contraceptive care and other health services. Looking back, Davis said that after Texas reduced funding for family planning care, ""over 150,000 real women lost the only health care that they had. Our Medicaid birth rate shot up. It cost taxpayers over $130 million in one year alone in extra Medicaid birth costs. So, not only does it harm real women, it costs taxpayers more."" Did she get that all those effects right? Legislative moves To recap, the 2011 Legislature drove down spending in a state family planning program by more than $70 million (from an existing two-year expenditure of $111 million) in 2012-13 and block family planning aid that flowed through a Medicaid-supported program from going to providers associated with abortions. Republican lawmakers also moved to remove Planned Parenthood from the state’s Women’s Healthcare Program, which provides low-income women access to family planning care. About two years later, legislators imposed stricter health and safety standards on clinics that perform abortions, a move expected to reduce the number of clinics from around 40 to 10; the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in November 2015 to review the law. Davis’ comments seemed curious in part because we found True in September 2015 a claim that Texas state government is ""funding women’s health services at historically high levels."" Most recently, the 2015 Legislature signed off on nearly $285 million in spending on several women’s health efforts, including $50 million for family planning services, in 2016-17. Per what Davis said, we looked into whether more than 150,000 women lost the only health care they had and whether the Texas actions drove up the number of births paid for through Medicaid. Davis offers backup Davis told us by phone her ""over 150,000"" figure came from a Texas Department of State Health Services report filed during a 2013 meeting of the State Health Services Council, which consists of nine members who gather feedback on the agency’s proposed rules and make recommendations to the agency and the overarching Health and Human Services Commission. Davis said: ""The report in the hearing showed that in 2013, the amount of women served (by the DSHS Family Planning Program) was 47,322, which was a decrease from 202,968 clients served in 2011,"" indicating ""a 77 percent decrease in the number of women served."" That would be a decrease of 155,646 women served—more than 150,000. That program, the state says, helps clinics provide comprehensive low-cost family planning and reproductive health care services to women and men. According to the state, the services help individuals determine the number and spacing of their children, reduce unintended pregnancies, positively affect future pregnancy and birth outcomes, and improve general health. A 2013 report An online search landed the report Davis mentioned and her cited figures as part of the council’s Nov. 21, 2013, meeting agenda. Yet the report, ""DSHS Family Planning Program Client Count and Average Cost Per Client, FY 2010-2013,"" didn’t specify women served; rather, it presented the ""number of women and men"" combined who received services from the DSHS Family Planning Program in the chosen years. So, how many women may have lost services? Additional inquiry led us to Enrique Marquez, a commission spokesman, who emailed us a chart indicating 181,460 women were served by the DSHS Family Planning Program in the state’s fiscal 2011, which ran through August 2012, while in fiscal 2013--after the actions by the 2011 Legislature--45,335 women were served. That’s a difference of 136,125--though that’s also without taking into account a decrease of 12,096 in women served by the state’s Women’s Health Program, which provides birth control, cancer screenings, annual exams and STD tests for low-income women. Women served by DSHS Family Planning Program and Women’s Health Program, FY 2011 - FY 2013 Program FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Difference (FY 2013 - FY 2011) DSHS Family Planning Program 181,460 76,898 45,335 136,125 decrease Women’s Health Program/Texas Women’s Health Program 127,536 126,473 115,440 12,096 decrease Total Decrease 148,221 Sources: Texas Department of State Health Services (numbers for DSHS Family Planning Program received by email from Enrique Marquez, Sept. 30, 2015; numbers for WHP/TWHP received by email from Bryan Black on Nov. 17, 2015) Add those up and you get 148,221, close to the 150,000 figure offered by Davis. Did women lose their only health care? Davis did not show nor could we determine the number of women who lost the only health care they had, as she put it. By email, HHSC spokesman Bryan Black said the agency has no way of estimating the number of women who were solely getting care through a state program. Separately, Sarah Wheat, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Texas, agreed with Davis that many women relied on its clinics for health care as did Janet Realini, who chairs the Texas Women’s Healthcare Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that says it’s dedicated to improving the health and well-being of women, babies and families by assuring access to preventive care for women. Researchers for the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, a project partnering with Ibis Reproductive Health, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, have been studying the effects of the changes legislated in 2011 and 2013. The researchers told us Davis was likely right about the women losing their only health care, but they also said there’s no way to pin that. Medicaid-funded births We previously found True a claim that more than half the state’s births are paid for by Medicaid. For this story, we looked into whether Davis was correct about Medicaid-funded birth costs increasing more than $130 million in a year. Davis told us she drew that figure from a January 2013 report, ""Texas Women’s Healthcare in Crisis,"" by the coalition chaired by Realini. That report noted a state projection of 23,000 additional Medicaid births in 2014-15, according to HHSC’s request for legislative appropriations covering 2014-15. The report, drawing on the same state projection, went on: ""Budget cuts to DSHS Family Planning program will increase Medicaid costs by at least $136 million by 2015."" The HHSC’s appropriations request at the time said those costs were projected to total $33 million in the year through August 2013 and an additional $103 million in fiscal 2014-15. By phone, Davis conceded she was off by saying the $130 million would accrue in a year; it was over two years. Separately, Realini cautioned, when we asked, that the presented projections covered three years, not one. Also, she said, the coalition hadn’t done a follow-up report. Over seven weeks, we asked the commission how much Medicaid births have cost taxpayers for each of the past five years, but didn’t field a response to that. Separately, neither the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare in Washington, D.C., nor outside experts could immediately provide such detail. So, did the rate of Medicaid-funded births surge? We inquired into whether the projections played out. To our inquiry, Marquez emailed a chart stating that in 2011, the year the family planning cuts were approved, there were 215,114 Medicaid-funded births in Texas. The tally dropped to 204,322 the next year. Medicaid-funded births in Texas, FY 2011 - FY 2014 Year Medicaid-paid births 2011 215,114 2012 204,322 2013 207,058 2014 213,253 Source: Texas Department of State Health Services (chart received from Enrique Marquez, Sept. 29, 2015) In 2014, after the cuts had taken effect, there were fewer--not more--Medicaid-funded births than in 2011, though the count had escalated in both 2013 and 2014. Our ruling Davis said that after the Texas cutoff of aid to women’s health services including Planned Parenthood clinics, ""over 150,000… women lost the only health care they had. Our Medicaid birth rate shot up. It cost taxpayers over $130 million in one year alone in extra Medicaid birth costs."" There was about that much of a drop-off in women participating in state-backed family planning and cancer screening programs. But Davis didn’t provide nor did we find confirmation all the women lost the only care they had or that Medicaid-funded birth costs actually spiked by the predicted $130 million-plus. In fact, there were fewer Medicaid-covered Texas births in 2014 than in 2011. We rate this multi-part claim Mostly False.

131,pomt-15106,"Georgia’s CRCT ""set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation.""",true,/georgia/statements/2015/sep/15/richard-woods/woods-claim-backed-reports-crct-wasnt-challenging-/,"The state announced the first round of the Georgia Milestones tests on Sept. 3 and, as predicted, scores were low. Only 10 percent of students who took a language arts or science course at any grade level finished in the top category of distinguished learners. In math, 60 percent of all Georgia students scored as beginning or developing learners. State School Superintendent Richard Woods said the new test sets standards that are higher, more comparable nationally and essential if students are to be college- and career-ready. ""Our previous assessment, the CRCT, set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation, and that cannot continue,"" Woods said in the press release announcing the results. The Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, or CRCT, is infamous for being central to the Atlanta Public Schools test-cheating scandals. Dozens of teachers and administrators risked careers and criminal prosecution changing CRCT scores to avoid losing bonus pay, even jobs. More than 20 educators pleaded guilty to reduced charges in the scandal. Eleven others were convicted in April on racketeering and other charges, receiving sentences from probation to three years in prison. Some are appealing. With all that said, did the CRCT really set some of the nation’s lowest expectations for student proficiency, as Woods suggests? ( Keep in mind that an easy test can still be failed.) First a little background about the CRCT. It stood as one of the primary measures of student achievement in Georgia from 2000 until it was retired in Summer 2014. The multiple-choice tests also were used to determine whether schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP), the benchmark of success under the federal No Child Left Behind law. The A-Plus Education Reform Act of 2000, pushed by former Gov. Roy Barnes, required all Georgia students in grades 1 to 8 to take the CRCT in reading, English/language arts and math. Students in grades 3 through 8 also were tested in science and social studies. A writing test was required in grades 3, 5, 8 and 11. Passing the CRCT was required for promotion to the next grade for students in grades 3 (reading) and 5 and 8 (reading and math). Who knew? Answer: Many Woods, who became state superintendent in January, isn’t saying something about the CRCT that hasn’t been said for years by some parents, teachers and certainly educators and education researchers/advocates. What was the tell-tale sign that the test was too easy? It was the wide gulf between passing rates on the CRCT and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), considered the gold standard of tests. The Education Trust in Washington D.C. raised a red flag back in 2006. The non-profit pointed out, for example, that 87 percent of Georgia fourth-graders were considered ""proficient"" in reading on the CRCT, but only 26 percent of a sampling of those same students were proficient on the 2005 NAEP reading test. (If the two tests had the same expectations, there should be a minimal gap. Wide disparities in results on the state and national test are referred to as the ""honesty gap."") State officials at the time said the report findings could lead to a strengthening of the test. If that happened, it doesn’t appear to have shown up in the data. A subsequent report from the group, relying on 2011 data, showed about the same results. Nearly 90 percent of students met standards on the CRCT, but only 32 percent did so on NAEP. It wasn’t a state secret either Our research turned up a report from the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, ""A Snapshot of K-8 Academic Achievement in Georgia."" The report said that performance on the CRCT had improved modestly between 2009-10 and 2012-13. But it said a comparison with national tests showed that Georgia set a low bar for proficiency on the CRCT and still ranked in the bottom half of national comparisons on NAEP. The report pointed out that a recent Education Next study found Georgia had the lowest mathematics and reading cut scores in the nation. (Georgia students had to answer fewer test questions right to pass the test, or be classified as proficient. About 50 percent was standard.) For 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, here's what a NAEP Mapping Study showed: (This study uses NAEP as a common scale to compare one state’s expectations of what their students should know and be able to do in order to be considered ""proficient"" on their state assessments to other states.) -- Georgia had the lowest numeric 4th grade reading expectations in the nation (Proficiency by NAEP standards was a scale score equivalent of 238 or better. But researchers found Georgia classified students who scored 167 or above, as proficient. No other state had that low a bar.); -- Georgia was third from the bottom on 4th grade math expectations (Georgia's NAEP scale score equivalent of 210 was numerically better than Maryland's and Alabama's; top was Texas at 256); -- Georgia was last in 8th grade reading expectations (Georgia had a NAEP scale score equivalent of 199 and was a distant last at that, with Idaho the next lowest at 217. Best was New York at 282 out of possible 500); -- and Georgia numerically ranked third from the bottom in 8th grade math expectations. (The state's NAEP scale score equivalent was 245, which is tied with Alabama, 245, and was followed by Connecticut, 244. Best was New York at 304, out of a possible 500.) ""Too many students were labeled as proficient when, in reality, they had not fully mastered the standards and needed additional support,"" Woods said recently. ""That hurt our kids who need to be competitive with others across the country and hurt our teachers by making it difficult for them to have a true picture of the academic strengths and weakness of their students."" Our ruling There’s ample evidence that, for years, Georgia’s CRCT ""set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation,"" as research has repeatedly shown and State Superintendent Richard Woods stated last week.

133,pomt-05029,"""Mitt Romney's companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/13/barack-obama/were-romneys-companies-pioneers-outsourcing/,"For Mitt Romney, a candidate who has made job creation the centerpiece of his campaign, it hardly helps to have news reports that Bain Capital invested in companies that moved jobs overseas. Based on that coverage, the Obama campaign produced a television ad that asserted ""Mitt Romney's companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries."" Our fellow fact-checkers at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post said similar claims from the Obama campaign were exaggerated. That prompted the Obama campaign to take the unusual step of pushing back with a long letter defending the claims. Subsequently, other news organizations have reported more on Romney’s time at Bain, which in turn led the Obama campaign to accuse Romney of not telling the truth about himself and the firm he once led. We decided to fact-check two parts of the Obama campaign’s statement. Were these really Romney’s companies? And were these companies actually ""pioneers in outsourcing"" ? Romney and his campaign have noted repeatedly that Romney left management of the company in 1999. That may be, but Romney was the company's founder, providing vision and direction for Bain. It's not as if his influence ended the moment he left to run the Olympics. Meanwhile, calling the companies ""pioneers in outsourcing"" overstates the case. They did promote outsourcing, but they were part of a trend already decades in the making. Romney's companies? Romney started Bain Capital in 1984. Its specialty was investing in new companies and helping them grow or taking troubled companies and turning them around. Romney likes to mention success stories like Staples, the office supply company. Some of these firms were deeply involved in outsourcing. The word ""pioneers"" comes directly from a June Washington Post article: ""During the nearly 15 years that Romney was actively involved in running Bain, a private equity firm that he founded, it owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories making computer components."" The Romney camp demanded a retraction on the grounds that some of the companies cited also created jobs in the United States. Others companies became part of the Bain portfolio after Romney took a leave of absence in February 1999, to run the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. The Washington Post retracted nothing. As an example, let’s start by looking at a company that Bain did control under Romney’s watch: Modus Media. Modus Media specialized in helping companies like IBM and Dell Computers manufacture hardware overseas. As FactCheck.org confirmed, it was controlled by Bain. No one argues whether Modus Media created jobs in countries such as Singapore and China. Now, if those jobs never existed in the United States in the first place, it is difficult to argue that Modus Media or Bain sent them overseas. But in 2000, the firm unambiguously disrupted the lives of about 200 American workers when it announced it was closing a plant in Fremont, Calif. and opening one in Guadalajara, Mexico. The Romney campaign argues that prior to this, Modus Media had created about 700 domestic jobs. We don’t know the quality and pay of those jobs and how they would compare to the jobs that were lost. But we do agree that those new jobs should be part of the overall picture. The Romney campaign has also repeatedly asserted that the plant relocation didn’t happen during ""Romney’s time."" FactCheck.org emphasized that the move took place ""more than a year after Romney had left Bain."" This issue of when Romney stepped down and whether he can be held accountable for things that happened after February 1999 has become something of a cottage industry in the media. Talking Points Memo, Mother Jones, and the Boston Globe have unearthed SEC filings and personal financial disclosure statements that list Romney variously as CEO, Managing Director, and president of Bain as late as 2002. Bain released internal memos that seemed to show Romney played no role in management decisions. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker added another document that lends weight to the argument that Romney was not part of Bain management after 1999. It is a 2002 Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission report certifying Romney’s eligibility to run for governor. It examined Romney’s activities when he took over the Olympics and based on weeks of testimony, the report revealed a man consumed with that task and who had no active connection to Bain. Looking at all the evidence made public so far, we do not think Romney was actively involved in the day-to-day management of Bain after 1999. But it doesn’t mean his influence disappeared after he left. Were they ""pioneers""? Romney was the company’s founder, and we think it worth a broader look at Bain’s investment practices, starting in the early 1990s. ""Typically, private equity companies tended to focus on companies in the $100 million to $500 million range,"" said Anant Sundaram, a researcher in mergers and acquisitions at the Dartmouth Tuck School of Business. More often than not, they turned them into companies worth $2.5 billion. Getting there was not easy. ""Did the private equity firms have the incentive to do a lot of cost cutting?"" Sundaram said. ""You bet. Was outsourcing one of the ways of cutting those costs? You bet. Everybody was doing it."" Our research shows that outsourcing was well established by the time Bain began buying shares in the companies described in the recent articles. To call these companies pioneers is a stretch. ""This had been going on for decades,"" said Tim Sturgeon a researcher who focuses on outsourcing at the Industrial Performance Center at MIT. Outsourcing grew significantly starting in the early 1990s thanks in part to the expansion of the Internet and changes in the rules of international trade. Bain was one of scores of private equity firms that participated. ""They were part of the herd,"" said Sturgeon. ""To say they picked the pioneers gives (Bain) too much credit for being innovative. It was a mainstream strategy by that point."" Every expert we contacted agreed that when Bain invested in the companies in question, it was counting on high returns that included the results of outsourcing. In that light, the exact month that Romney stepped away from Bain makes little difference. When Modus Media closed that plant in California in 2000, it was making the kind of move Romney and Bain expected when they first got behind it. The particular decision was not known, but the general nature of the decision was, the experts we spoke with said. Matthew Rice, Chief Investment Officer for DiMeo Schneider and Associates, a Chicago-based investment consulting firm, says he doesn’t see how Romney can divorce himself from the strategies that made Bain profitable. ""Technically, I guess he can,"" Rice said. ""But they would have done it anyway, whether he was there or not. If you can offshore and cut costs, you do it. Because if you don’t, the business might not survive and nobody would have any jobs."" And Bain would not make any profits. And the sole purpose of any fund, private equity or otherwise, is to make a profit. Our ruling The Obama television ad holds Romney responsible for sending jobs outside the country. It said ""Romney’s companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries."" We find reasonable grounds for labeling the companies as ""Romney’s."" He was the founder of Bain and assembled a team that looked to make high returns. One strategy was to invest in companies that played off the trend in outsourcing. We make no judgment on whether outsourcing is good or bad. It was widely seen as profitable, and Bain selected companies that would succeed. If picking a company makes it yours, then these were Romney’s companies and in a general sense, they did what he expected them to do. The one caveat is there is a gray area of direct accountability, because no one has reported that he was personally involved in managing those firms. We find little evidence that the particular firms were ""pioneers in outsourcing."" The Obama campaign took the word from the Washington Post but used it as its own. Outsourcing was well established by the early 1990s, and firms were applying it in a variety of industrial areas. The Bain companies were among that group. The Obama campaign's statement would have voters believe that Romney played a key role in driving the outsourcing phenomenon. We find that an exaggeration. We rule the statement to be Half True.",None,Barack Obama,None,None,None,2012-07-13T14:00:54,2012-07-03,['United_States']
134,pomt-03521,"""A bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple,"" and in some Milwaukee neighborhoods ""good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option""",mostly true,/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/02/mike-tate/mike-tate-says-cheetos-cost-less-apple-some-milwau/,"On a recent radio talk show, Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate gently criticized a widely discussed Republican bill mandating that food stamp recipients buy mostly healthy foods from a state-approved list. In doing so, Tate framed the debate around a certain orange-colored, cheese-flavored snack and a fruit grown in every state in the continental U.S. Tate spoke after one-third of Democrats in the state Assembly joined Republicans in approving the bill, which aims to cut down on junk food purchases seen as contributing to poor health in low-income families participating in the state’s FoodShare program. ""I’ll be honest with you, I think that having nutritional standards is an important thing,"" Tate told liberal radio talker John ""Sly"" Sylvester of Monroe’s WEKZ-FM on May 14, 2013. ""I think there is a need for government to play a role in the marketplace and having healthy, nutritious food be available for people on FoodShare that can’t have access to it. "" Tate defended those who voted for the bill as well-intentioned in trying to ease an obesity problem that is worse in Milwaukee and other urban areas, but said the legislation may not have been the best mechanism to do it. Tate also unpacked some specific claims about urban areas, specifically Milwaukee. ""You know, I think that it’s a problem that a bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple,"" he said. ""You go around some neighborhoods in Milwaukee and, good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option."" Milwaukee Common Council President Willie Hines Jr. made a similar statement in a recent opinion piece in the Journal Sentinel, saying that ""it’s generally a lot easier to reach for the less expensive Cheetos, doughnuts and Suzy Q’s than the more pricey veggie chips, granola bars and almonds."" Is Tate right? To check out the two parts of Tate’s claim, we reached out to local food experts, but also fueled up a car to test the food market in some of Milwaukee’s poorest north-side neighborhoods. In all we made purchases at 11 stores, ranging from full-line groceries to corner convenience stores and gas-station marts, mostly in Milwaukee but a few in neighboring suburban communities. The first thing that jumped out at us: At 2-for-$1, a single serving bag of Cheetos Crunchy (170 calories, 18 percent of recommended daily fat allowance) is hard to beat on price for a snack. In fact, many stores offer a whole range of chips at 50 cents a bag. By comparison, when we sought out single apples at the lowest per-pound or individual price available, we paid less than half a buck only once. At the top end, we paid $1.21 and $1.20 for an apple at two full-size markets and 65 cents and 99 cents at two convenience stores. Still, we were able to beat or match the Cheetos price, finding apples for 37 cents at a major Milwaukee supermarket, and for 50 cents at two city convenience stores as well as a supermarket in bordering Wauwatosa. Not every store had apples and not every store had single apples. That was just for snack-sized purchases. Bulk packaging, of course, drops the cost. We found 5-packs of gala apples (estimated 79 calories each, 0 from fat) at a small grocery in Milwaukee for the equivalent of 40 cents a piece, give or take a penny. And a chain supermarket near the edge of the city, in Shorewood, had bags of apples that averaged about 45 cents a piece. A chain store had them for 38 cents apiece in bulk. But Cheetos can drop even lower, to as little as 24 cents cents a bag, in 50-bag packs in combination with other snack chips, we found at one supermarket in Milwaukee. It was clear from our limited check that Cheetos are often cheaper than apples -- though not always. Prices, of course, can vary widely depending on quantity, timing, sales and other factors. And individual appetites can skew comparisons -- a 3.75-ounce bag of Cheetos Crunchy Flamin’ Hot is advertised as four servings but we’re guessing it doesn’t always go down that way. That bag will set you back $1.49 -- or about 37 cents a serving if you can stop after 21 pieces. Seeking fruit We sought out expert opinion on the larger issue Tate raised -- on the availability of healthy food options. Sherrie Tussler, executive director of the Hunger Task Force in Milwaukee, told us that many FoodShare recipients rely at least in part on convenience stores because they lack transportation to reach supermarkets that can offer fresher and sometimes less expensive products. Hunger Task Force, which opposes the state legislation as too expensive and complicated, closely tracks food availability in the city and plans to create a corner market emphasizing healthy foods. Residents in Milwaukee’s lowest socioeconomic-status group have more than twice the saturation of small food outlets as in higher-status neighborhoods, the Milwaukee Health Report 2012 study found. The annual report, by the Center for Urban Population Health, examines health disparities by socioeconomic status. ""There is strong evidence that access to supermarkets rather than smaller grocery/convenience stores correlates with lower prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hypertension,"" the study said. The report said obesity rates in Milwaukee -- which easily top the Wisconsin average -- are highest in lower-economic status populations. The Health Report study found that inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables is prevalent across all economic groups, but somewhat better at higher levels. ""A lot of it is because you can afford it and you can find it,"" said Geoffrey Swain, medical director for the Milwaukee Health Department and a co-author of the Health Report study. A close observer of convenience stores in town commented recently that corner convenience stores are the main food source for Milwaukee’s poor. ""Some stores do have fruits and vegetables, but are likely to be more expensive and of poorer quality, mainly because our nation’s produce distribution system is not geared to service the small mom-and-pop corner stores,"" Young Kim, executive director of the organization behind the north-side’s Fondy Farmers Market, wrote in May 14 column for Urban Milwaukee. Tate points to Kim’s piece as part of his argument on the difficulty in getting access to fresh fruit. Kim told us that fruit ""just isn’t nearly as readily available"" as some of the snack foods. ""Cheetos and a lot of those snack foods get delivered"" to small stores, in contrast to fruit, which small-store owners have to buy from larger stores and then mark up, he noted. Kim opposes the state legislation for singling out low-income people. In our spot check at five small stores, we, too, found that you can get some limited amounts of fruit at some corner stores -- as well as, of course, a full selection at the few larger food markets on Milwaukee’s north side. And we found that fruit quality was very mixed at the small stores, ranging from excellent to very poor. We learned that programs run by the Fondy Food Center and the Walnut Way Conservation Corp., among others, are working to try to put more fresh goods into local stores and educate people on healthy choices. The city of Milwaukee Health Department, through grant funding from the Healthier Wisconsin Partnership Program of the Medical College of Wisconsin, has provided funds for produce coolers in several convenience stores in the Lindsay Heights neighborhood on Milwaukee’s north side. At one store, Eagle Foods at N. 14th and W. Centers streets, we found fruit in a large and prominent display near a cooler stocked with take-out servings of cut fruit and vegetables, as well as mangoes and tomatoes. At the Families First store, 1845 N. 12th St., candy bars are behind a caged cashier, and a small stock of large Golden Delicious apples are front and center. There were a few tomatoes in the cooler, but overall the produce stock was very limited. Nobody’s suggesting that better access is a panacea for changing people’s dietary decisions. Consumer education is another key, Hines and other say. But experts told us that providing more choices is a necessary first step toward improvement. But there’s a steep hill to climb in terms of making good quality produce widely available. A 2008 study by the Neighborhood Health Alliance in Lindsay Heights, for example, found that more than 65% of the neighborhood retail food outlets offered no fresh produce. ""Residents indicated that key concerns were: poor food quality, poor access to quality fresh produce and healthy food options, and a lack of transportation,"" the study found. ""I don’t want to call it a ‘food desert,’"" Eric Gass, the Health Department’s public health research and policy director, said of Lindsay Heights. ""Food is available. It’s just not good food. There’s a term I’ve heard for that: a ‘food swamp.’"" Residents in the Amani neighborhood, near Lindsay Heights, who lack vehicles or can’t get a ride have to figure out how to cover a mile and a half or more to find a full-service store on the city’s north side, Tussler said. Buses are an option. ""Think bus fare,"" Tussler said in an email to us. ""Then how much can you carry? Then think once a month you pay for a taxi. You buy case goods because they don't spoil. You freeze meat and buy Wonder Bread because it doesn't mold. Then you get milk at the corner store."" While access to good quality, healthier foods has improved only marginally on the north side in recent years, Tussler said, ""the south side has been a big winner."" She noted the expansion by local El Rey markets and the addition of large stores such as the Pick ‘N Save at S. 19th St. and W. National Ave. Overall, on this part of Tate’s claim, we heard -- and saw for ourselves -- that fruit is for sale on the north side, but not necessarily in the kind of quantities that make it as affordable or as fresh as in some other neighborhoods. And getting to the store that has what a family needs can be a challenge for some. The legislation, meanwhile, was pending in the state Senate as of late May 2013. The city of Milwaukee took no position on the bill. Our rating Tate, the Democratic Party official, decried the lack of healthy and affordable food options in some Milwaukee neighborhoods. ""A bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple,"" Tate said, and ""good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option"" at stores there. He’s mostly right on the price comparison, and is partially accurate in suggesting it’s very difficult to locate fresh fruit. While fresh fruit can be found at big and some small stores, it’s more available in some low-income areas more than others, and getting there, finding it worth eating and paying for it are a challenge for some, according to experts and residents.

However, there is no evidence that Trump responded with her own threat against former President Barack Obama. Yournewswire.com cites an article in the Washington Free Beacon, which stated that pro-ISIS internet channels called for the assassination of the son of Melania and President Donald Trump. The Free Beacon attributed the information to the Middle East Media Research Institute, an organization that tracks jihadist propaganda. The institute found the information about the threat against Barron on Telegram, a social media network. Here’s what the group reported: On November 21, 2017, a supporter of the Islamic State (ISIS) on Telegram called for the assassination of Barron Trump, and shared the name of the school that Barron attends along with a Google map pinpointing its location. Using the hashtag ""handle the son of the mule of America,"" the supporter, who uses the name ""Dak Al-Munafiqeen,"" Arabic for ""striking the hypocrites,"" wrote: ""Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington."" The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post. The report drew scant mainstream media attention. While Telegram is used by a lot of people worldwide, it is particularly popular with jihadis and ISIS supporters, said Steven Stalinsky, MEMRI executive director. ""It's the main vehicle for ISIS and their supporters to use to communicate and put out propaganda,"" he said. The threat against Barron on Telegram from a supporter is not the equivalent of an official communique by ISIS, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact. ""The fact that someone on an ISIS channel said it online doesn’t make it a significant threat,"" he said. ""Anything said by some extremist on Telegram is not exactly breaking news that most outlets pick up in any way.""

137,pomt-14409,"""Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years.""",mostly true,/iowa/statements/2016/mar/11/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-ad-points-out-its-been-15-years-am/,"As Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to ""root out"" several barriers to progress in a TV ad that aired ahead of the South Carolina primary in February, she offered one specific statistic to underscore the challenges facing average Americans. ""Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years,"" she says in the 30-second ad, which aired more than 150 times on four networks in the Columbia, S.C., TV market beginning on Feb. 20 and lasting through the Feb. 27 Democratic primary. The spot was captured by the Political Ad Archive, a database maintained by the nonprofit Internet Archive. Incomes are obviously highly variable among individuals, and many people have seen their wages increase since 2001. But economists and federal agencies keep data on aggregate income growth that can tell us, on average, whether Americans’ incomes are rising. To evaluate Clinton’s claim, we’ll start by looking at inflation-adjusted median household income, which takes into account rising prices when comparing average income levels across time. According to an analysis of U.S. Census Data performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, median household income dropped from $57,843 in January, 1999, to $53,657 in January, 2014, the most recent period for which statistics are available. That’s a 7 percent drop, and supports Clinton’s assertion that Americans haven’t seen their incomes rise over the last decade and a half. (These figures account for inflation by expressing income from both years in 2014 dollars.) Another way to measure whether Americans have ""had a raise"" would be to look at a narrower slice of the population: full-time workers over the age of 16. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis draws on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to show median usual weekly earnings for these workers. In January, 2000, the average worker earned $334 a week. By January, 2015, that figure was $341 – a 2 percent increase. ($334 a week equates to $17,368 a year, while $341 per week is $17,732. These inflation-adjusted figures are expressed in 2015 dollars.) As we’ve explained before, we could judge Clinton’s claim on this second figure, since it captures people who are employed full-time on a wage and salary basis and who could receive a ""raise"" as that term is commonly understood. That said, median household income is the broadest measure of income growth, and arguably the more appropriate one to use in this context. Many households receive at least a portion of their income from government transfer payments, such as Social Security, or from investments – income that isn’t reflected in wages or salary data alone. Because median household income encompasses a wider range of income sources, it’s reasonable for Clinton to base her statement on that measurement. Our ruling Clinton’s campaign ad claims, ""Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years."" Inflation-adjusted median household income has indeed dropped 7 percent over that period, while earnings for wage and salary workers have increased a modest 2 percent.

138,pomt-01716,"""All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved.""",mostly false,/florida/statements/2014/aug/07/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-all-aboard-100-private-venture-and/,"Gov. Rick Scott has been on the defense for months about All Aboard Florida, a controversial passenger rail project that he supports. All Aboard Florida will run from Miami to West Palm Beach in 2016 and could extend to Orlando the following year. The project has faced opposition from some residents on the Treasure Coast, who fear noise and other impacts. And as he campaigns for re-election, Scott has faced heat for the role of his chief of staff, who previously worked for All Aboard’s parent company. A key point of contention has been about the role of public dollars in the project. In an interview with the West Palm Beach TV station WPEC June 30, Scott said: ""All Aboard is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved."" Scott made similar claims in June in a letter to the editor in the Tampa Bay Times and at a campaign event in Largo in July. His description of the ""100 percent private venture"" prompted an outcry from the Florida Democratic Party and opponents of the project. Media reports have also outlined the public funding -- and potential public funding -- associated with the project. Earl Barrett of Clearwater wrote a letter to the editor of the Tampa Bay Times in June seeking some clarity: ""A PolitiFact check seems in order."" Meanwhile, Scott’s likely nemesis on the November ballot, former Gov. Charlie Crist, made a claim that contradicted Scott’s assertion. ""All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars,"" Crist wrote in a July fundraising email. As the All Aboard controversy moved full steam ahead in August, we decided it was time for us to subject Scott’s and Crist’s statements to our Truth-O-Meter. What we found is that All Aboard Florida is a private enterprise, but it also takes advantage of infrastructure paid for by the government. So neither Crist nor Scott is telling the full story. Here, we’ll look in depth at Scott’s statement that All Aboard is ""100 percent private"" with ""no state money involved."" Scott has been asked why he rejected federal funds for high-speed rail in 2011 but now has shown support for All Aboard Florida. Republican Party of Florida Communications Director Susan Hepworth said in statements earlier this summer that the financing was vastly different: ""The proposed high-speed rail would have wasted millions of Florida taxpayer dollars by leaving the state on the hook for an unprofitable project. A private sector project — of any kind — not run on state funding obviously doesn’t have the same risks. Anyone saying these two issues are the same is being intentionally dishonest."" In 2011, PolitiFact Florida fact-checked Scott’s claim that high-speed rail would have cost Florida $1 billion. The state’s portion of the project was going to be $280 million -- Scott based his figure on a suspect study. We rated that claim False. All Aboard Florida All Aboard Florida is a $2.5 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2016, with hopes to extend to Orlando in 2017. Proposed by Florida East Coast Industries, LLC, All Aboard will use private financing for a large portion of its costs and has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. In the TV interview, Scott didn’t mention that federal loan, but his administration has acknowledged in press statements that federal dollars could be part of the project. So there’s definitely federal money involved, but is there state money? We found three points of contention here. Quiet zones: In response to residents’ concerns about noise from All Aboard trains, the Legislature this year approved $10 million in ""quiet zone"" money for horns at railroad crossings. Local government agencies can apply for the money for any rail crossing, not exclusively for those used by All Aboard. Local governments have until mid October to apply for the money so no money has been granted yet, Florida Department of Transportation spokesman Dick Kane told PolitiFact Florida. Tri-Rail: Tri-Rail is an existing government-run passenger rail service in South Florida overseen by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority. All Aboard mentioned in bond documents the possibility of using $44 million in state money to connect their trains to Tri-Rail, according to the Naples Daily News. While All Aboard and regional transportation officials talked about the idea of state funding, that never materialized and the Florida Department of Transportation officially shot down that idea amid all the publicity. So for now, there is no state money ""involved"" with connecting these two rail services. The Orlando International Airport: This is the most concrete connection between All Aboard and state funding. The airport is building a complex to include the airport’s people mover, parking and ground transportation. Connected to that project, the airport is also building an intermodal transportation facility -- and that’s the piece that will get about $214 million from a loan and grant from the state. The intermodal facility will accommodate rail -- including All Aboard Florida -- and potentially two other future rail projects, Phil Brown, airport director, told PolitiFact Florida. All Aboard Florida will pay the airport $2.8 million a year for a lease, which the airport will use to repay a portion of the state loan. In addition, All Aboard will pay the airport between $1 and $1.50 per passenger. (All Aboard Florida estimates that combined the total will add up to about $4.5 million a year.) ""Whatever they are using of that facility they are going to pay for,"" Brown said. The airport is required under federal regulations to charge fair market rate. ""The funding is for the Orlando International Airport, not All Aboard Florida,"" states a July 25 press release from FDOT. ""The airport will reimburse the state for the portion of funding related to the rail connection, whether it is All Aboard Florida or another private rail provider."" Our ruling Scott said in a TV interview that ""All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved."" While All Aboard Florida is a private venture, it has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. Also, the state is kicking in money for infrastructure, particularly for a new intermodal center at the Orlando International Airport. The funding for that infrastructure doesn’t go directly to All Aboard, but All Aboard does derive some benefit from the spending.

And in the other tweet, directed at Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Matt Canter, he went further, stating: ""Can’t back down from something (i.e. the individual mandate) that you never supported, Canter."" Taken together, Thompson is claiming he ""never supported"" the individual mandate. Never is pretty absolute, so let’s check the record. Opponents’ evidence Arguing that Thompson did support the mandate, Canter cited a video clip released by the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth the day before the Supreme Court ruling. (While the national Club for Growth has repeatedly attacked Thompson, and is supporting Republican Mark Neumann in the Senate race, the Wisconsin chapter has not.) In the clip, Thompson speaks at a national health care reform forum at American University in Washington, D.C. At the April 2006 event, held more than two years before Obama’s election, Thompson refers to reform in Massachusetts, saying: ""You’ve also got to consider strongly -- and I happen to support that, what Massachusetts did -- and that is requiring health insurance, the coverage of health insurance. This is a little bit opposed to what Republicans really think or propose. But the truth of the matter is, just like automobile insurance, you’ve got to have coverage. And if you’re going to be able to cover the uninsured, you’re going to have to have some degree of a mandate to cover the uninsured."" Both Canter and Club for Growth also cited video of a University of Texas speech in February 2007 in which Thompson says: ""I, for one, believe the mandate for health insurance is all right. We mandate insurance for automobiles. You know you can’t drive in Texas without automobile insurance. You can’t drive in any state without automobile insurance. It’s a mandate, but it’s certainly something that we should discuss in this country, and I think that’s positive."" So, Thompson said he supported Massachusetts’ health insurance requirement and said such a mandate is ""all right,"" although both statements were made before Obama’s reform efforts were launched. Thompson’s evidence To defend Thompson’s claim, his campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, said Thompson ""is the only candidate who has testified before Congress against the mandates."" He cited a portion of Thompson’s May 2008 testimony to the Senate Finance Committee: ""I am not convinced that the individual mandate is the correct approach,"" Thompson said, according to a transcript. ""We have seen in Massachusetts that the individual mandate approach is not effective at covering the most vulnerable part of the population, that part of the population which needs coverage the most."" So, after the generally supportive statements in 2006 and 2007, Thompson in 2008, shortly before Obama’s election, indicated he did not support an individual mandate. Nemoir also cited an August 2011 report by the University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org, which concluded that Club for Growth had falsely attacked Thompson as a ""champion of Obamacare,"" and he provided statements saying Thompson opposes what eventually became law. But Thompson’s past or current positions on the overall reform are not at issue here. In our item about Club for Growth’s claim about Thompson, Thompson’s campaign noted that Thompson at a July 2008 forum on a ""universal mandate"" for health insurance said: ""I don’t want a mandate."" But moments later Thompson said: ""I’m not opposed to it, I just don’t think it’s the most practical way."" Our rating Thompson said he ""never supported"" an individual mandate. But while he is now an opponent of the health care reform law and its mandate requiring most Americans to buy health insurance, Thompson said in 2006 he supported a mandate and in 2007 said a mandate is ""all right.""

Both senators visited Petraeus in Baghdad, received testimony from him in Washington and greatly admired the general’s leadership of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reed and McCain, former military officers and the Republican and Democratic leaders of the committee, repeatedly voted for Petraeus’ various postings, including his appointment as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2011. Then in 2012 the roof collapsed on Petraeus’ career after a scandal involving an extra-marital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, prompted his resignation in 2012 and eventually led to his misdemeanor criminal conviction for inappropriately handling classified information. Now, in a letter to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, the two senators have come to the defense of the disgraced four-star general, whom they called ""brilliant."" Carter is considering retroactively demoting the retiree, which could take away one of his stars and slash his annual pension from about $220,000 to as low as $170,000, according to recent media reports. The senators’ Jan. 20 letter says a retroactive review of Petraeus’ retirement, coming one year after the general admitted his guilt and apologized, would be ""manifestly unreasonable and unfair."" ""It is rare that a retirement grade determination is conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces,"" says the letter, which is signed by both senators. The statement made us wonder, is it rare? Petraeus can’t be the only former military officer convicted of a crime. What happens in other cases? First, let’s look at the Petraeus case. After returning from Afghanistan during the summer of 2011, Petraeus held onto eight black notebooks that contained classified information such as the names of covert officers, war strategy and other intelligence matters, according to an admission he made at his plea hearing. ""On or about"" Aug. 28, 2011, says the court record, Petraeus provided the notebooks to his biographer. He retired on Aug. 31, and he retrieved the notebooks on or about Sept. 1. Later, in October 2012, while Petraeus was serving as CIA director, he spoke to two FBI agents and admitted his involvement in an affair with Broadwell, telling them their relationship began after he left the military. He denied providing classified information to Broadwell, which was a knowing and deliberate false statement, according to an admission he would make later in court. In November 2012, he resigned as CIA director. FBI agents recovered the notebooks from Petraeus’ home, where he had kept them in violation of the law. In March 2015, he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor. In the U.S. Army, a process called grade determination"" governs the rank an officer retires at and also affects retirement pay. Such determinations ""are normally accomplished at the time of retirement"" and remain ""fixed"" thereafter, according to Army regulation 15-80. But the Army can lower the grade of a retired officer if any misconduct while on active duty is documented by a conviction in the wake of the officer’s retirement, says the regulation, which also talks about ""substantial new evidence"" triggering a review if it’s ""discovered within a short time following separation."" Reed and McCain argue that too much time has passed for such action. The specific sequence of events that might lead the Army to retroactively demote a retiree are quite rare to begin with, according to Anita Gorecki-Robbins, a lawyer and former Army Judge Advocate General officer who represents members of the military in grade determination proceedings. First of all, she said, the officer’s active-duty misconduct -- or lawbreaking -- must stay off the radar prior to his or her retirement. Then after retirement someone must tell the Army’s review board about it. During her 15 years of experience, she’s never encountered such a case. We asked both senators to substantiate their claim that such retroactive grade determinations are rare. Reed’s spokesman, Chip Unruh, consulted the Department of Defense and the Army and told us both entities confirm there has been only one case in the last decade involving the retroactive demotion of a retired three star or four star general. Looking at the officers’ corps at large, it’s rare for anyone to advance to the rank of three-star general and it’s rarer still for an officer of such a lofty rank to be criminally charged. And then consider the circumstances of the Petraeus scandal, involving a storied war leader and former CIA director. As Gorecki-Robbins says: ""This is truly a unique set of facts."" Our Ruling In their letter, McCain and Reed told the defense secretary, ""It is rare that a retirement grade determination is conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces."" That claim is True. That’s our ruling. But we feel compelled to point out that the procedure itself is rare and it’s rarer still to see an American military officer rise so high and fall so far.",None,Jack Reed,None,None,None,2016-01-31T00:00:00,2016-01-20,['United_States']
141,pomt-05161,"Barack Obama has ""provided guns to Mexican drug cartels.""",half-true,/texas/statements/2012/jun/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama/,"Addressing the Republican Party of Texas convention, Gov. Rick Perry said the country erred in 2008 by electing the wrong person as president. ""Three and a half years, and nearly 100 rounds of golf into his presidency, Barack Obama has exploded the federal debt, passed a failed, budget-busting stimulus package, socialized health care, and provided guns to Mexican drug cartels,"" Perry said June 7, 2012. ""Admit it, America -- 2008 was our national ‘oops’ moment!"" We recently confirmed Obama had played nearly 100 rounds of golf as president. And PolitiFact reporters have previously explored claims about the debt, the success of the stimulus package and whether the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act amounts to socialized health care. Perry’s claim that Obama ""provided guns to Mexican drug cartels"" struck us as novel. Is it correct? Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Perry was referring to the botched federal gun trafficking investigation on the U.S.-Mexico border known as Fast and Furious in which federal agents lost track of hundreds of firearms they were letting flow into Mexico from Arizona as part of an effort to build cases against Mexican drug cartels. The multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation took place from late 2009 to early 2011 -- during Obama’s presidency -- under the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, an agency of the Justice Department. In the operation, agents purposely allowed weapons to be illegally purchased and circulated on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, as the Los Angeles Times said in a Dec. 8, 2011, news story. Two of the weapons turned up after a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed in southern Arizona, the paper said, though for a January 2012 fact check, we found no information supporting a claim that ballistics tests confirmed that the found weapons killed the agent. The Times said scores of other guns in the operation were reportedly used in violent crimes in Mexico, adding: ""While the aim of Fast and Furious was to track weapons, instead it ended up significantly arming the Mexican drug cartels."" And did Obama have a hand in the endeavor? We looked for indications. In a March 22, 2011, interview with Univision, posted online by CBS News, Obama said neither he nor Attorney General Eric Holder authorized Fast and Furious and pointed out that the operation was under internal investigation. ""We don’t have all the facts,"" Obama said. Asked if he was informed about the operation, Obama replied: ""Absolutely not. This is a pretty big government, the United States government. I’ve got a lot of moving parts."" He added: ""Our policy is to ramp up the interdiction"" or capture ""of guns flowing south, because that’s contributing to some of the security problems that are taking place in Mexico."" In an interview the same day with CNN Español and an October 2011 interview with ABC News, Obama said he learned of Fast and Furious from news reports. He further said to CNN: ""We have to make sure that we are interdicting the flow of guns and cash to the south. It's not enough just to interdict drugs flowing north. And so, we've actually initiated a whole range of measures to make sure that we're reducing that southbound flow."" Noting that Holder had launched the internal investigation into Fast and Furious, Obama told ABC ""it is not acceptable for us to allow guns to go into Mexico... So it's very upsetting to me to think that somebody showed such bad judgment that they would allow something like that to happen and we will find out who and what happened in this situation and make sure it gets corrected."" We looked for other signs of Obama’s role in the operation, finding nothing to contradict his accounts. In 2011, staff to the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, issued two Fast and Furious reports. The June 14, 2011, report covers Fast and Furious accounts of ATF agents. The July 26, 2011, report explores the impact of Fast and Furious on Mexico. The reports do not gauge Obama’s involvement. A January 2012 report by House Democrats says the strategy of permitting illegal guns to flow to cartels in Mexico in hopes of building cases against vital figures originated with federal law officers in Arizona in 2006, which was when George W. Bush was president. ""Unfortunately, this strategy failed to include sufficient operational controls to stop these dangerous weapons from getting into the hands of violent criminals, creating a danger to public safety on both sides of the border,"" Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, told colleagues in a Jan. 30, 2012, letter summarizing the report. His letter says Fast and Furious was the fourth federal operation since 2006 in which gun-walking occurred. Finally, we reached the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who has been critical of Fast and Furious. Grassley spokeswoman Jill Gerber provided a partially redacted document that appears to be a Jan. 8, 2010, briefing paper on Fast and Furious originated by federal authorities based in Arizona. Its bullet point No. 13 opens: ""Currently our strategy is to allow the transfer of firearms to continue to take place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order to further the investigation and allow for the identification of additional co-conspirators who would continue to operate and illegally traffic"" firearms to Mexican drug trafficking organizations ""perpetrating armed violence along the Southwest Border."" Informed of Perry’s statement, Gerber said by email: ""It’s more accurate and complete to say the ‘Obama administration’ provided guns to Mexican drug cartels rather than"" to ""say President Obama himself did so."" Our ruling Fast and Furious, intended to send guns to Mexican drug cartels toward building cases against key figures, took place on Obama’s watch. However, unlike the other results bemoaned by Perry at the convention -- growth in the federal debt and the passage of Obamacare and the stimulus -- we see no indication Obama had an influential role in the border operation. That is, there is no sign that Obama either initiated or approved the deliberate flow of guns to cartels.

142,pomt-01875,"""As Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary, Mary Burke spent $12.5 million dollars to buy a vacant lot for a company that said it had no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin"" and had laid off 800 workers.",mostly true,/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-ad-says-mary-burke-helped-firm-no-pla/,"In his latest TV ad, Gov. Scott Walker rips challenger Mary Burke’s attempt to attract a giant Illinois-based company to add thousands of jobs in Wisconsin when Burke ran the state Commerce Department under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. ""As Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary, Mary Burke spent $12.5 million dollars to buy a vacant lot for a company that said it had no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin,"" the ad says. ""In fact, the same company had already laid off over 800 workers when Burke closed the deal."" The ad’s kicker: ""Mary Burke says she’ll work to create jobs and spend our tax money wisely. But her record as Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary tells a different story."" Is Walker right about his likely Democratic opponent in the November 2014 election? Did Burke really authorize an aid package for a company that ""said it had no plans to create jobs"" here -- after massive layoffs at the firm? The Burke campaign reacted to the ad by saying: ""Everyone from local officials to the local chamber of commerce to Walker's own administration agrees that this was and is a good deal from an economic development standpoint. The grant contained strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met or infrastructure was not developed for economic development."" Let’s dig into what happened. The ad focuses on a major move by Doyle and Burke in the spring of the 2006 election year. In March 2006, they announced a $12.5 million forgivable loan funded through federal community block grant funds, the largest such award in Commerce Department history. It was to support development of 500 acres acquired in Kenosha County by global pharmaceutical maker Abbott Laboratories Inc. Abbott, a major employer of Wisconsin residents based just 15 miles south of Kenosha County, had purchased parcels of land on the Wisconsin side since June 2005 for possible expansion. Doyle and Burke sought to augment that purchase with another 40 acres paid for with the $12.5 million state award. They and local officials wanted to get the land in order to block plans for a truck stop they thought could impede development in the area. Judging by the comments of Doyle and Burke at the time -- she had ""full confidence"" 2,400 jobs would result; he welcomed the company to Wisconsin -- you’d have thought Abbott had already announced its expansion in early 2006. But the Journal Sentinel reported Wednesday that not only did no jobs materialize, federal officials in 2013 demanded the money back. Eight years after the 2006 deal, Abbott has not developed the Kenosha County land. Abbott showed interest Did it have ""no plans"" to create jobs, as the Walker ad claims? In one sense, Abbott clearly had shown an interest in possible expansion in Wisconsin, as evidenced by the land purchases made with its own funds. The possibility was real enough for local officials in Kenosha County to actively work on working on paving the way for the firm. The company paid out $35 million for those parcels. But that solid interest fell short of an actual plan to build and start hiring. (The company, we should note, also signed a development agreement with the Village of Pleasant Prairie to develop that land. But that was a year after Burke’s agency made the award). The company didn’t stand alongside state officials when Doyle announced the loan in 2006. And officials said precious little about their intentions at that time. Here’s a look back: Chicago Tribune story, Feb. 14, 2006: ""Abbott has acquired approximately 500 acres of land in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., in anticipation of future growth and expansion,"" a company spokesman said. ""No specific plans are in place at this time for development of the property."" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, March 3, 2006: Abbott spokesman Jonathan Hamilton said the Wisconsin site is for future growth, without any specific plans at this time. Commerce Department newsletter, April 2006: ""Abbott has purchased this land in Wisconsin in anticipation of future growth and expansion,"" said Dale Johnson, the company’s divisional vice president for State Government Affairs. ""We are pleased to have worked with the Governor, his staff, the Village of Pleasant Prairie and the Kenosha Area Business Alliance."" Those comments made clear the company was preparing for possible expansion in Wisconsin, but had no specific plan at the moment. Feds object One media story, in the Chicago Tribune in February 2006, speculated that Abbott’s Wisconsin land buys might be leverage for the company on various issues it had before Illinois lawmakers. With the uncertain timetable in mind, the Commerce Department’s aid deal was long term. If in 10 years, at least 2,400 jobs were created by Abbott in Wisconsin, the loan -- actually made to the village of Pleasant Prairie, which passed the funds to Abbott -- would not have to be repaid. In theory, that means there is still time to make the expansion happen with help from the loan. But the US Housing and Urban Development office in Milwaukee demanded the $12.3 million back in 2013 saying the development project was ineligible for the block grant dollars the state had used. The reasons the federal agency cited in its decision are relevant to judging whether Abbott stated any plans to create jobs in Wisconsin. A letter from HUD to the state in August 2013 concluded that the Commerce Department had no written commitment from Abbott to develop the property or create jobs. State officials agreed to that deal at the time. The federal agency declared that ""Commerce participated in a speculative land banking venture"" without ensuring that the funded activity would be eligible. Even years later, ""the specific proposed use of the acquired land has not yet been identified,"" HUD’s Sernorma Mitchell wrote to state Department of Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch. Those comments from HUD help Walker’s case. Finally, the Walker ad also mentions layoffs, citing Chicago newspaper stories. Media in Illinois reported that Abbott cut at least that many jobs in Illinois in 2005 and early 2006. Our rating Walker’s ad said: ""As Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary, Mary Burke spent $12.5 million dollars to buy a vacant lot for a company that said it had no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin"" and had laid off 800 workers. There’s a hint of mischief in the ad’s language in that it can be heard to mean that Burke was so incompetent she gave money to a firm with zero interest in a Wisconsin operation. That idea is off base. But as we say at PolitiFact, words matter, and the ad’s claim closely mirrors what company officials said at the time of the award. And HUD officials found that even seven years later, no specific use for the land was proposed. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.",None,Scott Walker,None,None,None,2014-07-10T05:00:00,2014-07-08,['Wisconsin']
143,pomt-09885,"""14,000 Americans . . . lose their health insurance every single day.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/24/barack-obama/obama-claims-14000-lose-health-insurance-every-day/,"In his nationally televised news conference on July 22, 2009, President Barack Obama cited a dramatic statistic to emphasize the need for health care reform. He said, “If we don't act, 14,000 Americans will continue to lose their health insurance every single day.” The White House told us the number came from a report published by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and authored by researchers James Kvaal and Ben Furnas. A chart in the report was headlined, “14,000 People Became Uninsured Every Day in December and January.” We wondered about the methodology and whether the December and January numbers were out of date. We couldn't reach the authors of the study (one has since joined the White House staff). But we tracked down Urban Institute health care scholar John Holahan, whose work was cited in the Center for American Progress study. Holahan was the co-author, with A. Bowen Garrett, of the January 2009 study, “Rising Unemployment, Medicaid and the Uninsured,” published by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. That study provided the underpinning for the Center for American Progress report by estimating how many people can expect to lose their insurance when the national unemployment rate goes up. Holahan and his co-author, using a baseline of 4.6 percent unemployment in 2007, calculated that 2.6 million people would lose coverage if the unemployment rate climbed to 7 percent; 3.7 million if it went to to 8 percent; 4.8 million at 9 percent; and 5.8 million at 10 percent. The estimates took into account people who lost their jobs but then switched to a spouse’s plan or extended their coverage through COBRA, the federal law that guarantees people who lose their job can still get continued health coverage. Applying Holahan's calculations to the actual rise in unemployment from November 2008 to June 2009, we came up with 3.2 million people losing health coverage, or an average of 15,238 per day, so it is close to the 14,000 Obama cited. We asked other health care experts about Holahan’s work, and they uniformly agreed that he is a respected researcher. Only one complicating factor emerged, when we spoke with Edmund F. Haislmaier of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He noted that Holahan’s paper was written before passage of the federal stimulus package, which contains provisions subsidizing 65 percent of COBRA costs for the unemployed. If these new subsidies end up boosting the use of COBRA — the data hasn't been compiled yet — then it could reduce the number of newly uninsured Americans from the levels that Holahan had predicted and that Obama cited. Obama was very close to Holohan's calculations — in fact he was slightly low. But as Haislmaier pointed out, the stimulus COBRA provisions could reduce the numbers because more people will still be covered. We can't be sure until the data is in. So in the meantime, we find Obama’s claim Mostly True.",None,Barack Obama,None,None,None,2009-07-24T14:33:52,2009-07-22,['United_States']
144,pomt-02541,Says Bill O’Reilly spoke 40 percent of the words in an interview with President Barack Obama.,mostly true,/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/06/dana-milbank/milbank-oreilly-said-40-words-obama-interview/,"At least among Fox News viewers, nothing boosts audience like taking President Barack Obama to task. The day after Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had an interview with Obama, O’Reilly picked up an additional 1 million viewers for his show The O’Reilly Factor. The president sat down with O’Reilly right before the Super Bowl, and the tone of the conversation itself stirred up a flurry of reactions. Here’s a small example from a moment when O’Reilly pressed Obama on the administration’s response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. O’Reilly: If (Ambassador to the United Nations) Susan Rice goes out and tells the world that it was a spontaneous demonstration... Obama: Bill... O’Reilly: -- off a videotape but your... Obama: Bill... O’Reilly: -- your commanders and the secretary of Defense know it's a terror attack... Obama: Now, Bill... O’Reilly: Just... Obama: -- Bill... O’Reilly: -- as an American... Obama: -- Bill -- Bill... O’Reilly: -- I'm just confused. Obama: And I'm -- and I'm trying to explain it to (you), if you want to listen. No wonder that many observers described the interview as testy. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank called it ""the roughest and nastiest exchange"" of the three times that O’Reilly has interviewed Obama. ""He interrupted the president 42 times in 10 minutes,"" Milbank said on MSNBC’s Politics Nation. Of all the words uttered in this 10-minute interview, 40 percent were uttered by O’Reilly."" We wanted to check Milbank’s numbers. Not on the interruptions, but on the word count. We pulled out our digital centrifuge and separated the O’Reilly and Obama utterances. According to our research, O’Reilly delivered 787 words to Obama’s 1,484. This gave O’Reilly 35 percent of the conversation. That’s a little lower than Milbank said but more or less in the same ballpark. We reached out to Milbank and did not hear back. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare this with another one-on-one interview between the president and a journalist. A couple of days before Obama sat down with O’Reilly, he did the same with CNN’s Jake Tapper. We subjected that transcript to the same rigorous methods and found that Tapper spoke 23 percent of the time, leaving the president the other 77 percent. The precise word counts were Tapper -- 849 and Obama -- 2,886. Milbank’s point was that O’Reilly’s interview was almost as much about O’Reilly as it was about the president. We don’t know about that, but we can say that O’Reilly spoke about 50 percent more than Tapper did in his interview. The topics in the two interviews differed greatly. O’Reilly brought up Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Tapper focused on issues like immigration reform, legalization of marijuana, spying by the National Security Agency, and security at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. O’Reilly had a second installment of his time with Obama that aired the night after the Super Bowl. Milbank’s comment came on the same night, so we’re counting only the segment that had aired publicly at that point. For the record, in the second installment, O’Reilly asked the president about African-American children raised in single-parent households, school vouchers, the Keystone pipeline, a contraceptive coverage exemption for Little Sisters of the Poor, and veterans benefits. Our ruling Milbank said O’Reilly said 40 percent of the words during his interview with the president. That was a little high. By our count, 35 percent would be more accurate. O’Reilly spoke decidedly more than Tapper did in his time with Obama.

A version of it has been posted on a variety of blog sites, including this one. Here are excerpts: ""I had no idea that this Congresswoman was such a nut case. ""It was a tragedy that 19 people were shot and six died. As a result Giffords will be held out as a saint, when in fact, she is an idiot , a left wing ‘enviro-nut’ who should not be in Congress.

I'm just saying that battle plans should include an environmental impact assessment as a regular part of the process before attacks are launched.’ ""She also suggested that the Army ‘put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.’"" We found it hard to believe that a member of Congress would actually say that the Army should ""put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output."" So we set out to find the source. Our friends at Snopes.com provided the first clue, noting in a post from July 28, 2010 -- six months before the Tucson shooting -- that a false e-mail had been circulating about Giffords’ alleged questioning of Petraeus. Snopes.com explained that on June 16, 2010, Petraeus had testified before the House Armed Services Committee and that one of the lawmakers who questioned him was Giffords. She did indeed ask a question that combined elements of environmental and military policy, but the line of inquiry was rather different than what the e-mail suggested. ""There's been a lot of attention back here in the United States on what's happening with the BP oil spill,"" Giffords said at the hearing. ""And as we all know, the largest user of energy on the planet is actually the United States Air Force, and the (Department of Defense) is the largest user of energy in the United States. And I really want to commend the work done on behalf of DOD, and also what's happening in the field with our energy, but it's an area that I just really want to focus on. ""And I know a lot of questions have been asked, but during the last three years, supply lines have increasingly threatened -- have been threatened, either by enemy action or through international places. And in places like Kandahar, where we have a large presence, we have been plugged in to a very unsustainable and really an incapable grid system. ""We know that a major part of the upcoming Kandahar offensive will include some serious repairs and upgrades to the energy system which include small-scale solar and hydropower systems, and also some solar-powered streetlights. I'm just curious whether or not there's plans to utilize any of those same technologies at our bases around Afghanistan, and wouldn't that greatly reduce our need for fuel?"" In other words, Giffords did not ask, ""General Petraeus, what are you doing to reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror?"" -- as the e-mail indicated -- but rather asked him whether the use of alternative energy sources could provide a more reliable and more secure power source for troops located in a faraway, unstable theater of operations, potentially relieving soldiers from having to defend vulnerable supply chains required to move conventional forms of energy. And that’s where the e-mail checked by Snopes.com ended. The version we received added new claims, including the parts about battlefield environmental impact statements and about Giffords urging American forces to club, rather than shoot, enemy forces. These comments were also absent from the transcript of the June 16, 2010, hearing. But we were able to track down the source: a July 17, 2010, post at the Arizona Conservative blog that was clearly labeled ""Semi-News — A Satirical Look at Recent News."" Here’s the entire satirical post: ""Army’s ‘Carbon Footprint’ Taints War Effort ""Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Az) took Afghan Commander, General David Petraeus, to task for what she characterized as ‘willful disregard of the environmental impact of our war effort.’ ""‘There is no policy, no plan to minimize carbon emissions in our military activities,’ Giffords charged. ‘Bombs are dropped and bullets are fired without considering the environmental impact.’ ""Giffords insisted that she was ‘not demanding an immediate halt to current military operations in the Middle East. I’m just saying that battle plans should include an environmental impact assessment as a regular part of the process before attacks are launched.’ ""She also suggested that the Army ‘put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.’"" In other words, the chain e-mailer cut and pasted the satirical post -- but, whether intentionally or accidentally, left out the crucial label ""satirical."" We reached out to two people who have posted or forwarded the item but did not hear back. So where does this leave us? In the hearing, Giffords did indeed raise an issue involving alternative energy with Petraeus, but it was not to express a concern that the military should ""reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror"" -- rather, it was to improve energy reliability and security for American forces on the ground. And the claims that Giffords urged American forces to club, rather than shoot, the enemy in order to reduce carbon emissions were pure satire but not labeled as such by the chain e-mailer. All told, the claims in the chain e-mail are ridiculous. So we rate this chain e-mail Pants on Fire! UPDATE: Shortly after we posted the story, the man who wrote the satirical post in July 2010 returned our e-mail. ""I have been writing about 300 satirical pieces a year since 2005,"" said John Semmens. ""Only once did I directly see one passed around as real news."" Semmens said he has been contacted by journalists about a half dozen times over six years, so seeing one of his pieces circulate in this way strikes him as ""a relatively unusual event.""",None,Chain email,None,None,None,2011-03-01T16:38:23,2011-02-24,"['David_Petraeus', 'Gabrielle_Giffords']"
146,pomt-01919,"Says 95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said in a survey ""we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty.""",half-true,/texas/statements/2014/jun/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-accurately-recaps-survey-result-indicatin/,"People have increasingly crossed into Texas over the Rio Grande because they think Uncle Sam has open arms, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the other day. Cruz, at a San Antonio press conference with fellow Republicans Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, said a May 2014 government survey of over 200 people apprehended trying to enter the country illegally proves his point. Asked ""why are you coming here?,"" Cruz said, ""95 percent said we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty. We are coming because if we get here, we were told that we are allowed to stay, that we will have a permiso."" We wondered if most recent arrivals are citing expectations of amnesty. Record crossings Tens of thousands of people, including children mostly from Central American countries, have been crossing the border, resulting in a record number of non-Mexicans getting apprehended. Accounts have varied on why more are coming than before. For instance, a June 16, 2014, National Journal news story quoted Leslie Velez, a senior protection officer at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, as saying its 2014 interviews of 404 children revealed many were fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. Survey says... And what was Cruz citing? By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out June 2014 news stories in The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner summarizing a Border Patrol survey reportedly brought to light in an undated document Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed into the records of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a June 2014 hearing. A copy of Grassley’s document, emailed to us by Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s office, describes May 2014 interviews of adults and children by Border Patrol officers in the agency’s Rio Grande Valley sector. By telephone, Grassley spokeswoman Beth Pellett Levine said the senator knows a whistleblower summarized the interviews, though she said that as of June 24, 2014, Homeland Security hadn’t confirmed or denied the document’s authenticity. By email, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, declined to comment on the four-page document. According to the document, the agents interviewed 230 adults and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala on May 28, 2014. The focus, the document says, was to ""obtain a general consensus as to why"" the border crossers ""are migrating en masse"" into the country through the Rio Grande Valley. The word ""amnesty"" doesn’t appear in the summary of results. Also, the document says in many cases, ""the subjects mentioned more than one reason,"" including gang-related violence, extreme poverty, high unemployment, poor living conditions and subpar educational circumstances -- with many women mentioning domestic abuse. Still, the document says, the main reason interviewed individuals ""chose this particular time to migrate"" was to ""take advantage of the ‘new’ U.S. ‘law’ that grants a ‘free pass’ or permit (referred to as ‘permisos’) being issued by the U.S. government to female adult"" non-Mexicans ""traveling with minors and to"" unaccompanied children."" The document says the issue of ""permisos"" was the ""main reason provided by 95% (+/-) of the interviewed subjects."" The document doesn’t confirm any new law and we’re unaware of any. Confusingly, too, the document says the permisos are ""Notice to Appear"" documents, but it also says those documents aren’t free passes to stay in the country. Rather, the document says, the notices are routinely issued to undocumented entrants ""when they are released on their own recognizance pending a hearing before an immigration judge."" The document goes on to say the granting of permisos ""is apparently common knowledge in Central America and is spread by word of mouth, and international and local media. A high percentage of the subjects interviewed stated their family members in the U.S. urged them to travel immediately, because the United States government was only issuing ‘permisos’ until the end of June 2014,"" while several people said they’d heard they’d be issued only through May 2014, the document says. Most unaccompanied children, the document says, stated they were going to join a parent or parents or other family members already in the country. The children ""stated they wanted to take advantage of the ‘permiso’ being issued by the U.S. government to minors traveling alone."" Many children cited high crime in their countries and forced recruitment into gangs, the document says, with others mentioning educational opportunities in the U.S. Outside lawyers: ‘It’s not amnesty’ To our telephone inquiries, immigration lawyers who looked over the Grassley-publicized document offered different interpretations of the references to permisos. Each one also said it would be inaccurate to interpret the permisos as amnesty, as in passes to remain in the country without risk of being deported or other penalties. Elizabeth Lee Young of the University of Arkansas School of Law, who emailed us a ""Notice to Appear"" document, characterized it as an immigration court summons. ""Most of the people know it’s a notice to go to court,"" Young said. Anyone who doesn’t show up for their court date, she said, is subject to immediate deportation. Significantly, Young said, no one caught after crossing is given a work permit, which is how she said she usually interprets ""permiso."" Detainees given a notice near the border, the lawyers told us, can then be held in a government facility or released deeper into the country on personal recognizance -- as children and women with children often are, the lawyers said. Toni Maschler, a Washington, D.C., attorney, said generally, she considers a permiso a permit, like a driver’s license, and not the notice to appear for an immigration hearing. Maschler speculated the document’s references to permisos were really to the document that releases someone on their own recognizance. Lisa Brodyaga, a lawyer in San Benito, close to the Texas-Mexico border, similarly said the document’s references to permisos probably mean paperwork related to releases on personal recognizance, which she said clear the way for women and unaccompanied children to leave the border region; men, for the most part, she said, are kept in detention. Each release ""allows you to get out of detention, allows you to travel, it allows you to go be with your family,"" Brodyaga said, ""and, as long as you go to your hearings when you have them, it allows you to stay in the United States. It’s a ‘permit,’ until you get deported."" ""It’s nowhere near amnesty,"" Brodyaga said, which would mean ""you are forgiven for something. You’re not forgiven. You’re subject to the laws of the United States… This does not entitle them to remain indefinitely."" Similarly, Maschler said the release on personal recognizance is ""not amnesty. It doesn’t give anybody a permanent right to stay in the United States."" Young said: ""Amnesty would indicate some form of legal waiver of your undocumented presence or entry. That is not the situation."" Apprised of the lawyers’ assessments, Cruz’s spokeswoman said by email Cruz didn’t say that any legal papers deliver amnesty to border crossers. The point is people are coming because they think they’ll be allowed to stay, as they have been, Frazier said. Our ruling Cruz said a survey indicates 95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said ""we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty."" This statement accurately recaps a statistic in a document made public by another senator: 95 percent of 230 adults and unaccompanied children interviewed recently by the Border Patrol gave as the main reason for their journeys the U.S. government issuing permisos, which the document defines as notices to appear in immigration court enabling recipients to stay in the country at least until then. But that’s not ""amnesty,"" as in an absolution enabling people to stay indefinitely without risk of penalty, and indeed ""amnesty"" goes unmentioned in the survey summary. Also, as unsaid by Cruz, the immigrants listed other reasons for coming, including crime and violence in home countries. The document, with its anonymous origins, doesn’t specify how many individuals singled out these other factors. Another study, in which the United Nations earlier surveyed twice as many immigrants, pointed to gang violence as the vital factor.

147,pomt-05547,"""As the usage [of synthetic marijuana] has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it.""",mostly true,/georgia/statements/2012/apr/09/nathan-deal/deal-fake-marijuana-use-rising-connected-death-vio/,"Phony marijuana targeted by recent state legislation sounds worse than the real thing, if you believe Georgia’s governor. Chase’s Law strengthens a ban on ""synthetic marijuana,"" ground-up plant material laced with chemicals that mimic marijuana. Chase Burnett, the bill’s namesake, was found dead in March in a hot tub at his Fayette County home, a packet of the drugs nearby. He was 16. The bill passed with overwhelming support. On March 27, Gov. Nathan Deal signed it into law. A press release warned of synthetic marijuana’s dangers: ""As the usage has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it,"" it said. We’ve heard that the drug is nasty stuff. But what’s this about violence, bodily harm and death? A Deal spokeswoman sent PolitiFact Georgia news stories and poison control data to prove the governor’s point. We also talked to researchers and law enforcement officials and reviewed news stories and scientific studies. The form of synthetic marijuana that’s sparking so much concern is sold at head shops and gas stations under brand names such as ""Spice"" and ""K2."" Georgia made it a felony to manufacture and sell it in 2010. Chase’s Law tries to keep underground chemists from tweaking their recipes to get around state restrictions. There’s little scholarly research on the drug, which appears to be new to the U.S. Federal labs first detected these drugs in November 2008, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The earliest U.S. news story we found about its rising popularity appeared in a Hutchinson Kan., newspaper in November 2009. All signs suggest that synthetic marijuana use is increasing dramatically, but data is in short supply. Workers at the American Association of Poison Control Centers began tracking synthetic marijuana calls in 2010 after they noticed more inquiries, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. In 2010, they received 2,906 calls; in 2011, there were 6,959. About 11 percent of high school seniors reported using synthetic marijuana in the past year, according to 2011 results of an annual survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It was the first time researchers asked about the drug. Existing data support Deal’s claim that reports of bodily harm have climbed. Georgia Poison Center call data show 10 users were admitted to a hospital’s critical care unit in 2010 after using the drug. Forty-five were admitted in 2011. Rapid heartbeat, agitation, drowsiness, vomiting, hallucinations and nausea were among the drug’s most common effects, researchers have found. Media accounts report drug users injured in car crashes, falls and other accidents -- some fatal. Whether synthetic marijuana is directly responsible for deaths -- and whether they’re increasing -- is a more complicated issue. We found no published studies on the drug’s lethality, but there have been ""scattered reports of deaths,"" said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan professor who conducted the National Institute on Drug Abuse survey. A count of news stories suggests there are more deadly cases. But whether the drug is a direct cause or contributing factor is not clear in some instances. Consider Burnett’s death. Toxicology tests are still in the works. Whether the official cause of death was drowning, the drug or something else is unsettled. Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told PolitiFact Georgia of two other recent deaths: Two chemicals used in synthetic marijuana were found in the system of a man, 43, who died Sept. 8 in Cherokee County. The official cause of death was chronic high blood pressure. Toxicology results are pending in the Feb. 20 death of a 26-year-old Clarke County man. Police found two packages of synthetic marijuana on his bathroom sink, one partially used. We found other accounts of synthetic marijuana-related deaths. For example, a South Carolina coroner ruled that it was directly responsible for the October death of a college basketball player who collapsed during warm-up, according to multiple news accounts. PolitiFact Georgia found less support for Deal’s claim about violence. We found no published studies on the subject. News stories, however, suggest there’s cause for concern. For instance: In September, a Bulloch County man told emergency dispatchers he and his girlfriend smoked Spice and it made him act ""crazy,"" a sheriff’s report said. When deputies arrived, they found him holding his girlfriend, who was bloody and beaten. He said he attacked her. In 2010, an 18-year-old Iowa man fatally shot himself after smoking the drug. To sum up: Evidence supports Deal’s claim that use of the drug has ""dramatically increased,"" as has synthetic marijuana-related ""bodily harm."" Some evidence suggests that deaths have risen, too. The link between the drug and violence is less clear. News accounts suggest there is an increase in both, but we found so few cases it’s hard to tell. Deal’s statement could use clarification. Still, it earns a Mostly True.",None,Nathan Deal,None,None,None,2012-04-09T06:00:00,2012-03-27,['None']
148,pomt-09269,"Says the American public ""overwhelmingly opposed"" Democratic-steered health care plan.",half-true,/texas/statements/2010/apr/29/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-says-democrats-passed-hea/,"U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, speaking for Republicans in response to President Barack Obama’s weekly radio address on Saturday, spiced a call for keeping watch over the nation’s financial sector with a ‘plaint about Democrats’ stewardship of recently adopted health care legislation. ""Americans are troubled,"" Hutchison said, ""by the way Democrats forced their health care bill on the public that overwhelmingly opposed it."" We missed the whips and chains in the health-care fight and wondered if Hutchison imagined things, considering key actions took place by majority votes. That said, we're setting aside this part of her statement as partisan hyperbole. For this article, we’re focusing on Hutchison’s claim that the American public ""overwhelmingly opposed"" the health care plan. PolitiFact.com previously looked at references to public opinion and the health care legislation. In February, it found Mostly True a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, that 75 percent of the American people ""have said either don't do anything (on health care) or start over."" And in March, PolitiFact.com rated as Half True Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth's statement that polling showed almost 40 percent of Americans opposed the health-care plan because they didn’t think it went far enough. Responding to our inquiry, Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky told us that from late April 2009 to late April this year, telephone calls and letters mostly sent by Texans to the senior Texas senator ran heavily against ""Obama’s health care"" approach. More than 18,100 callers were opposed while 4,830 were in favor; about 75 percent of more than 350,000 letters that Hutchison received were against the reform, Sadosky said. Still, signals from Texas constituents don't necessarily demonstrate national sentiment. We turned next to polls taken before and after the final congressional action, which was followed in late March by Obama signing the plan into law. According to almost every poll we found, more Americans opposed action than favored it as the debate reached its climax. According to a Gallup poll taken March 4-7, weeks before the final votes, 48 percent of Americans said they would advise their representative to vote against an Obama health-care reform measure with 45 percent saying they’d advise a favorable vote. At the time, Gallup said the result confirmed ""the generally divided nature of public opinion on health care legislation."" Seeking to gauge whether Americans' opposition was overwhelming, as Hutchison puts it, we reviewed summaries of polls compiled by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable font of information on health care. From our sampling: A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll taken March 19-21 asked individuals if they generally favored or opposed the health care plan then awaiting final action. The tally: 39 percent in favor, 59 percent against and 2 percent with no opinion. A Bloomberg poll taken those same days found 38 percent of respondents in favor, 50 percent opposed and 12 percent not sure. Some other polls showed a narrower approval/disapproval gap. A Quinnipiac University poll taken March 22-23 found 40 percent mostly approving of the health care system changes just passed by Congress, 49 percent mostly disapproving and 11 percent not knowing or answering. In a CBS News poll taken March 18-23, 42 percent said they approved of the ""current health care reform"" measure, 46 percent were opposed and 12 percent said they did not know or declined to answer. And a poll taken March 23-26 by The Washington Post found 46 percent of respondents supporting the changes to the health care system just enacted by Congress and Obama with 46 percent opposed. A Gallup poll taken in early April showed a near-even break between Americans saying passage of the plan was a bad thing and Americans saying it was good. Forty-nine percent of individuals polled April 8-11 said it was a bad thing with 45 percent saying it was good. Generally, Gallup writes, ""over the past year, Americans have been remarkably stable in their assessments of the bill, with neither supporters nor opponents able to generate sustained majority agreement with their position."" Doubts remain high in Texas, according to an April 14 telephone poll by Rasmussen Reports. Sixty-seven percent of surveyed likely voters favor a proposal to repeal the health care plan to stop it from taking effect, with 28 percent opposing such a move. Where does all this leave Hutchison’s claim of overwhelming opposition at the time lawmakers acted? Certainly, many Texans clamored against approval. And national polls show more Americans opposed the action than supported it. But Hutchison overreaches by calling that opposition overwhelming. We rate Hutchison’s statement as Half True.",None,Kay Bailey Hutchison,None,None,None,2010-04-29T21:21:57,2010-04-24,['United_States']
149,pomt-12602,"""Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines all found murdered.""",pants on fire!,/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/04/blog-posting/doctors-deaths-were-not-connected-fake-news-websit/,"A fake news story tried to connect the random deaths of doctors with conspiracy theories around vaccination. Neonnettle.com posted a story headlined,""Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines found murdered,"" on March 2, 2017. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site's efforts to clear fake news from users' news feeds. The story claims that the doctors found the enzyme nagalase in vaccines, connecting nagalase to cancer, autism and diabetes. The article speculates that the doctors were murdered in order to prevent their findings from going public. We reached out to the website but got no response. Their argument is that nagalase suppresses the immune system and would therefore be bad if found in vaccines. There have been controversial studies that claim to show that the GcMAF protein, which aims at reduction of nagalase concentration in the body, could be treatment to diseases like cancer, autism, or HIV. These are all diseases where the nagalase level is supposed to be high. That theory lacks scientific evidence, though. The British government has warned against the purchase of GcMAF, since it is not licensed and its production does not adhere to production standards. Scientific journals where those theories were published have retracted them, because they are not proven. Healthnutnews.com identified five doctors it said were connected to the nagalase discovery. But we found little evidence that the deaths of doctors are were connected to the vaccine controversy. Dr. Bruce Hedendal, a 67-year-old doctor in Florida, was found dead in his car in June 2015. The actual cause of his death is not clear, but natural causes have been cited by Florida local TV stations. Hedendal was a chiropractor, and there are no reports that he was involved in challenging the pharma industry in any way. Another doctor from Florida, Dr. Theresa Ann Sievers, 46, was found murdered in her Florida home in 2015. An investigation found that her husband Mark had hired two men, Curtis Wayne Wright Jr. and Jimmy Rodgers, to kill her so he could collect insurance money. Again, her death was not connected to the pharmaceutical industry. In a follow-up article, healthnutnews.com broadened the theory to include two additional doctors. Dr. Jeffrey Whiteside, 63, went missing after a fight with his wife and was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide. Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick,a 74-year-old retired eyedoctor, went missing while hiking in Montana. The police searched but never found him. A officer of the Gallatin County Sheriff’s office told the Bismarck Tribune that Fitzpatrick may have suffered from occasional confusion, due to his advanced age. He also said that they had no reason to believe criminal activity was involved in this case. The only person who was actually involved in the vaccination debate was Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, 61. He became controversial for his claim that vaccines could cause autism, a theory that has been refuted by several studies. Bradstreet treated his autism patients with the GcMAF protein, which the FDA does not recognize as treatment for autism. According to the Rutherford County, N.C.. Sheriff’s Office, his wounds appear to be self-inflicted. He was not murdered. But his death in 2015 gave way to a wave of conspiracy theories. While the article says these doctors died in connection with promoting theories about vaccines, only Bradstreet’s case even comes close. And even that is a stretch. As for sourcing, neonnettle.com refers to thebigriddle.com, which posted the exact story a year ago. Thebigriddle.com cites conspiracyclub.co as its source, a site that doesn’t exist anymore. Our ruling The article puts forward a conspiracy theory that is based on the actual deaths of American doctors, but there is no information that they worked together on vaccine discoveries, nor were their deaths connected. The conclusions in the article are pure speculation. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com",None,Bloggers,None,None,None,2017-04-04T14:00:00,2017-03-02,['None']
150,pomt-00310,"Says ""Texas U.S. Rep John Culberson voted to let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/24/lizzie-pannill-fletcher/texass-fletcher-tries-hit-culberson-obamacare/,"Affordable health care is a salient issue in the 2018 congressional elections, and an ad from a Houston Democrat has a familiar ring. Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, hoping to unseat Republican U.S. Rep. John Culberson in Texas’s 7th Congressional District, says her opponent ""is taking a wrecking ball"" to a system that needs improvement, not demolition. It’s an ad with a particular appeal to older voters, because Fletcher says in it that ""Culberson voted to let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people."" Maybe you’ve heard similar claims before. Democrats across the country are using them against their Republican opponents, and PolitiFact has checked out many of them. But we went a little local on this one. Let’s dig in. No discounts for age Fletcher and other Democrats are basing this claim on provisions in the American Health Care Act, passed by the House of Representatives along party lines on May 4, 2017. The bill was rejected in the Senate. The legislation was important for several reasons, but chiefly because it would have changed — and not simply repealed, as earlier bills had attempted — the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare. The new bill would have allowed insurers to charge certain customers over age 50 -- those buying policies in individual and small-group markets -- up to five times as much as they charge their youngest customers. Age has always factored into the price of insurance for the simple reason that older people tend to use more health care services. But the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, limited the age-to-premium ratio: The oldest insurance buyers in the individual and small group markets could be charged no more than three times the premiums as the youngest buyers. Say that premiums for a 20-year-old were $100 a month. A 60-year-old could be charged no more than $300 a month for the same policy under the ACA. Prior to Obamacare, ""premiums for older adults were typically four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation said in a March 2017 report. So the Republican House bill would have lifted the age-permitted ratios closer to where they were before the Affordable Care Act. Gaming this out There were ifs, ands and buts concerning this proposed change. But before we get to them, let’s look at how the age change might have played out if the House bill had become law. We are able to do this because the Kaiser Family Foundation developed a data and mapping tool that allowed for illustrative comparisons of insurance policy costs under the existing and the proposed new laws. This was strictly for people buying policies on the individual market, not for employer-sponsored insurance. We ran scenarios comparing premiums for a silver-tier, or average plan, covering a 27-year-old and a 60-year-old living in Harris County, Texas — the Houston area. As commercials say, actual results might vary, and it’s worth noting that just because the law allows something, it doesn’t mean every situation will match it. In the Kaiser model, premiums for the 27-year-old were $3,340 a year on the individual market under the ACA. Premiums for a 60-year-old were $8,660. That means the 60-year-old’s premiums were about 2.6 times higher than the 27-year-old’s. Under the House bill that Culberson supported, the 60-year-old’s premiums would have jumped to $11,630, while the 27-year-olds would have shrunk to $3,080. That means that in this example, the 60-year-old’s premiums would have been nearly 3.8 times as high as the 27-year-old’s. This illustration shows premiums before accounting for taxpayer subsidies, or ""premium tax credits,"" that many buyers use to offset their costs. The ACA subsidies are based on overall income, but they also take into account federal guidelines for the maximum share of income someone should have to pay for health insurance and the cost of a benchmark plan in his or her area. The House bill that Culberson supported would have changed the subsidy system, basing it solely on age, although subsidies regardless of age would phase out when incomes exceeded $75,000. A number of analyses, including one from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said such a change would generally benefit younger buyers and force older buyers to pay more out of pocket for their premiums. Using the Kaiser Family Foundation data tool, we looked again at Houston scenarios for a 27-year-old and a 60-year-old each earning $40,000 a year. The 27-year-old currently doesn't qualify for a subsidy because his income is too high -- relative to the cost of his health coverage -- under the ACA. But under the 2017 House bill, he would have qualified for a $2,000 age-based subsidy. That would have reduced his out-of-pocket costs for premiums to $1,080. A 60-year-old with that same income now qualifies for a $4,580 subsidy. Under the bill Culberson supported, the age-based subsidy would be $4,000. That would put the 60-year-old’s net premiums, after subsidies, at $7,630, seven times more than the 27-year-old’s. Remember, the new law would limit the difference in base premiums, not the amounts due after accounting for subsidies. Would things have played out like this for sure? It depends on the moving parts. This example showed a narrower difference than five-to-one before subsidies, but actual differences change not only by region of the country but sometimes also by county. Nationally, AARP said on the day of the House vote that under the bill, unsubsidized premiums for 60- to 64-year-olds would average almost $18,000 per year, while 20- to 29-year-olds were expected to see average unsubsidized premiums of $4,010 per year. That would make the older group’s premiums 4.5 percent higher than the younger group’s. Our ruling Fletcher was accurate in saying that Culberson voted to ""let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people."" But she did not mention that the ACA already lets them charge three times more. Her ad also could give the impression that this would have applied to everyone over 50, whereas it only would have affected the individual and small-group markets. It would not have affected large employer plans. And the Republican bill would not have affected people 65 and older because they are covered under Medicare, the national program for seniors.

Lloyd Doggett told ABC News on Aug. 11, 2011, that Gov. Rick Perry’s rosy depictions of employment conditions in Texas aren’t entirely accurate. ""Twenty-five states have lower unemployment than Texas does today,"" the Austin Democrat said, adding that ""we're tied with Mississippi for more minimum-wage jobs than anywhere in the United States."" Is Texas middling in unemployment and tied with the Magnolia State for minimum-wage jobs? Yes and yup. According to the latest monthly state-by-state unemployment rates, posted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas’ seasonally adjusted June unemployment rate of 8.2 percent placed it 26th among the 50 states. North Dakota had the lowest rate, 3.2 percent. The most populous states faring better than Texas were Pennsylvania, ranked 18th (7.6 percent), and New York, which was 23rd (8 percent). Regarding minimum-wage workers, the Austin American-Statesman said in a July 17 news article that Texas and Mississippi led the nation last year with 9.5 percent of hourly workers earning at or less than the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25. Hourly workers aren’t the entire labor force, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as adults who are working plus those lately looking and available for work. The Statesman story says that according to the bureau, 550,000 Texans earned no more than the minimum wage in 2010, and the number of Texas workers earning the federal minimum wage or less was greater than the totals for California, Florida and Illinois combined. In the story, Lori Taylor, an associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, attributes the state’s lower wages to its having a younger, less educated workforce and a lower cost of living. In March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in an online post that nearly 5.8 million Texas workers were paid hourly rates in 2010, representing 55.7 percent of the state’s workers, a proportion that compares with 58.8 percent nationally. A bureau economist, Steven Haugen, told us in an interview that most other workers are salaried, though some work on commission or do piece work; the bureau doesn’t collect data on those workers’ pay rates, he said. A table in the bureau’s post lists each state and its percentage of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage (people who work for tips and worker younger than 20 are among those who can be paid less than minimum wage). Texas and Mississippi each had 9.5 percent of hourly workers paid at or less than minimum wage, tying for first among the states. Under Texas law, employers must pay workers the federal minimum wage. Alabama and West Virginia, at 9.3 percent, were next highest, followed by Louisiana (8.9 percent), Oklahoma (8.6 percent), Georgia (8.5 percent), Tennessee (8.3 percent), Kentucky (8.1 percent) and Missouri (8 percent). Washington, which has a state minimum wage rate higher than the federal rate, had the lowest share of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage, 1.1 percent. In sheer numbers, Texas had 268,000 hourly workers earning minimum wage and 282,000 paid below the minimum wage, the bureau says, the most of any state by a wide margin. Almost 13 percent of the nation’s hourly workers paid at or below the minimum wage were in Texas, the second most-populous state with more than 25 million residents, or about 8 percent of the nation’s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Mississippi, with almost 3 million residents, had 34,000 and 29,000 hourly workers, respectively, earning the minimum wage or less.

152,pomt-08913,"Rob Portman’s ""plan to tax, slash and privatize"" Social Security ""would devastate Ohioans.""",mostly false,/ohio/statements/2010/jul/28/lee-fisher/fisher-campaign-claims-portmans-plan-tax-slash-and/,"Step on the third rail of American politics and you’ll get scorched by angry retirees. That adage about Social Security comes from the 1980s, but politicians like Ohio’s Lee Fisher are testing it against opponents today. Fisher’s campaign seeks to singe Rob Portman, the rival running for U.S. Senate, for efforts to partially privatize Social Security in the past, and for potential Social Security benefit cuts and tax hikes in the future. In a July 12 news release, Fisher spokesman John Collins said: ""Seniors depend on a guaranteed monthly Social Security benefit -- especially in these tough times. Congressman Portman's plan to tax, slash and privatize these benefits would devastate Ohioans. Pure and simple."" Pure and simple, it sounds scary. But is it true? To support its claim, the Fisher campaign cited a Columbus Dispatch story in which Portman said he would look at ""everything on the table"" when considering how to deal with looming problems for entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, ""including at least a discussion of possible tax increases and benefit cuts."" And Fisher’s news release said that while in Congress, Portman was ""an outspoken advocate for privatizing Social Security -- a plan which would have left Ohio's seniors devastated during this recent economic downturn."" Asked to back up the claim further, Fisher’s campaign cited statements, TV and Web interviews, congressional hearings, and news articles from when Portman, a Cincinnati-area Republican, served in the House of Representatives and worked as President George W. Bush’s budget director. It is indisputable that Portman supported Bush’s proposal to allow Americans to put part of their Social Security contributions into private accounts. Americans would be able to invest in stocks, bonds, government securities or stay out of the accounts entirely. ""I mean, this is what Einstein talked about, the magic, the greatest force in the universe, the power of compounding interest,"" Portman, then a congressman, said in a House Budget Committee hearing in 2005. ""That's what we're talking about here."" It’s easy today to see how badly a Wall Street downturn would affect that magic in the short term. But that oversimplifies the case. Bush and congressional Republicans made their strongest push for privatization – they preferred to refer to it as private accounts – in 2005 but did not intend for such a program to start right away. Portman noted at a news conference in early 2007, when he was Bush’s budget director, that the president had already pushed back the proposed start date to 2010, and then in 2007 he pushed it back again to 2012. At the time, Portman said the accounts would be strictly voluntary and comprise only a portion of anyone’s Social Security savings. Furthermore, Portman said in 1999, when the subject was in its incubation phase, that ""there must be a safety net for everybody so that no one’s Social Security benefits would be reduced."" This might have required a taxpayer bailout if stock market losses packed a wallop, but that’s not the issue here. Still, Portman was unquestionably a privatization champion, saying in 2005 that it was reasonable to expect a 5 percent annual return on investment, ""which I think is conservative."" But that’s not the same as having a current ""plan to tax, slash and privatize these benefits,"" as the Fisher campaign suggests Portman has now. Asked about any such plan, the Portman campaign said it hasn’t developed one. Portman has only said that everything must be on the table when discussing entitlement reform. That could put Portman at odds with AARP, which says that solutions must not come at the expense of ""today's seniors and future generations."" But it puts Portman on the same page as President Barack Obama , who said in April when naming a commission to address this nation’s debt: ""Everything has to be on the table."" Collins, the Fisher spokesman, suggests this is a cop-out for Portman because right out of the gate, Portman includes the potential of tax increases, benefit cuts, or both. ""His plan includes an open discussion of taxing and slashing benefits,"" Collins said. ""And our plan would not start with that. We would not consider that."" Portman has in fact said that Social Security’s solvency might require pain, although he viewed private accounts as better alternative. Otherwise, he said in 2005, ""We're going to have to raise taxes, we're going to have to borrow, we're going to have to cut benefits -- we're going to have to do something."" In an interview with Human Events Online, Portman later said that private accounts would over the long term ""deal with the solvency issue."" That was then, this is now -- and Portman has not mentioned private accounts in a long time or talked about whether his views have changed. He only says that with deficit, debt and entitlement problems growing, the nation needs a serious discussion. To get everyone to the table, says his spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, Portman believes that no possible solutions should be eliminated out of hand. As for the possible fears of seniors or anyone hoping to retire, she notes that as a congressman, Portman voted in 2000 to reduce the percentage of Social Security benefits subject to taxes. He voted in 1995 to repeal a tax increase on Social Security benefits. And he voted in 1996 to allow beneficiaries to earn more outside income without losing their Social Security benefits. The claim against Portman has a substantial short-coming. Agreeing to hear others out is not the same as agreeing to ""slash"" or ""tax."" And favoring privatization before, in a dramatically different economic climate, is not the same as pushing for it now. It would be credible to cite Portman’s past actions and question what he might do now. But in saying that Portman has a plan to do so, the claim becomes Barely True. Comment on this item.

153,pomt-02197,"""Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee. It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power.""",mostly false,/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/24/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-unleashes-oklahomas-sun-tax-misses-c/,"Rachel Maddow sharply criticized Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin on her MSNBC show Monday for imposing a ""sun tax"" on residents who install solar panels or wind turbines to conserve energy and save on their electric bill. But Maddow’s searing attack is misleading, says even a solar energy trade association. Maddow topped her April 21 broadcast with the story of SB 1456, connecting the ""sun tax"" law to conservative-driven efforts in other states to dial back state-approved benefits for utility customers who use alternative energy sources like small wind turbines and solar panels. (In Oklahoma, wind turbines are more prevalent than solar panels, for the record.) ""Tonight Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee,"" she said. ""It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power. If you want to use the sun for electricity instead of your local coal fire power plant, the redder-than-red state Oklahoma government has figured out a way to make you pay for that crime."" But the law mandates no special fee or fine as Maddow says. What SB 1456 does is crack open the door for Oklahoma’s utility companies to apply to charge future ""distributed generation"" customers (the ones who invest in solar and wind energy devices on their properties) a tariff, surcharge, fee, or whatever you want to call it. But that fee or ""fine"" could only come after extensive court-like hearings before a state regulator, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. And there are questions if that will happen. In signing the proposal into law, Fallin released an executive order that repeatedly stressed the bill does not mean a fee or surcharge is the only way to deal with the concern of utility companies. Fallin ""specifically said the bill does not mandate an increase for solar customers,"" said Bryan Miller, president of the pro-solar group Alliance for Solar Choice. While Miller opposes a fee or surcharge should one come, he said Maddow’s segment missed the mark. Miller called Fallin’s executive order ""a tremendously positive step for the future of Oklahoma in promoting distributed generation."" ""Even without the executive order, it was a very misleading story,"" Miller said. MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski said the show stood by its reporting. ""The order declares the governor’s recognition that renewable energy is important, but it does not, in any codified way, meaningfully change what the new law does,"" Skowronski said. ""The law was opposed by advocates of solar power for the very reason that it is designed to impede the expansion of solar usage among Oklahoma consumers, and the governor’s executive order does not change that."" We’ll unpack all of this a little more for you. Oklahoma’s explanation SB 1456 moved quickly through the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature. State Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican whom Maddow mocked during her April 21 show for proposing an all-out ban on marriage, was the primary House sponsor of the bill. He introduced it on the Oklahoma House floor this way: ""Members, this bill effectively allows our senior citizens as well as our lower-income individuals in this state to no longer bear the cost of the way that we do accounting."" That’s not a very detailed or transparent explanation for what SB 1456 is really about, but no one asked questions before passing it on an 83-5 vote. (One lawmaker asked Turner a question privately as members voted, and Turner could be heard saying, ""This doesn’t raise, it’s not what people think."") Turner told PunditFact he was not acting at the behest of utilities, the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council or Koch brothers by supporting the Senate bill, as Maddow suggested during her broadcast. Still, a pro-solar Republican group went against him for sponsoring the bill in a video ad suggesting he turned on conservative principles by ""taxing solar."" ""It’s not a tax,"" Turner told PunditFact of his bill. ""You have to be a willing customer."" A self-described opponent of subsidies, Turner says Oklahoma’s 350 or so customers who use wind, solar or other alternative energy devices are being subsidized by other utility customers under current law. Here’s his argument. Most people who have wind- and solar- energy devices are not completely off the grid. They access the grid on cloudy or low-wind days, utilities say. Like most states, Oklahoma has a net-metering law that allows ratepayers who install solar panels and microturbines to sell excess energy they generate for use by their nearest neighbor. The utility, compelled by federal law, must buy back this energy at the retail rate, so the ""seller"" is charged only for their net energy use (what they sell minus what they use). Before Turner’s bill became law, utility companies could not charge solar customers for extracting the excess energy with their infrastructure. Turner says solar panel customers fail to compensate the utility companies for harnessing the extra power. As a result, that additional cost is picked up by other customers. Spokespeople for the state’s two largest utility companies, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and the Public Service Company of Oklahoma, say the current system is giving an unfair break on grid ""maintenance costs"" to customers who use solar or wind power. ""What we credit them for energy they generate greatly exceeds the value of that energy,"" said Stan Whitehouse, Public Service Company of Oklahoma spokesman. ""Distributed generation is no longer in its infancy, and as potential for growth grows, the subsidization will only increase."" This bill could fix that inequity, the utilities say, by letting the state utility regulator ""set up a new rate for distributed generation that would be very clear about here is what you owe to cover the cost of the grid maintenance and here is the amount of electricity you use,"" said Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokeswoman Kathleen O’Shea. Practically speaking, the fee would eat into the credits solar and wind customers accumulate from selling excess energy back to the electrical grid -- a concept that pro-solar groups, including Miller’s Alliance for Solar Choice, oppose. To Maddow, that’s a tax. To Turner, it’s eliminating a subsidy. The law, which goes into effect Nov. 1, says utilities would have to get new charges approved by the end of 2015. What SB 1456 does Specifically, the law modifies a 1970s-era law that prevented utilities from increasing rates or imposing a surcharge because a consumer installed a solar energy device. The change would not affect existing customers. The law says a higher fixed charge for new customers with energy-saving equipment is ""a means to avoid subsidization."" Emphasis on ""a,"" Miller said. ""It says you can have a fee, but it doesn’t say you have to have a fee,"" he said. The practical effect of the bill for future solar and wind customers is unclear until the state’s utility regulator starts the process of reviewing a fee request from a utility. Arguments for and against would be reviewed by an administrative law judge, who would make a recommendation to Oklahoma’s three-person Corporation Commission. The commission could approve the fee or surcharge, reject it, or order additional review. To approve the fee -- and this is important -- the Corporation Commission would need to conclude solar and wind customers are being subsidized by other energy users. Alternative energy users would still save money by selling their excess energy, they’d just save less. The law does not just affect solar users. Mike Bergey, Bergey WindPower Co. president and CEO, sent a letter to Fallin expressing profound disappointment for signing the law because uncertainty about a fee will hurt microturbine sales by dissuading customers interested in investing in a nascent industry. Oklahoma does not offer state incentives for residents who install small-scale solar and wind devices, so ""it’s a rare customer"" who is willing to take the investment leap. A federal tax credit defrays some of the cost of a small $65,000 wind system, but extra utility fees would extend the payback period that customers usually recoup from reduced bills. ""Certainly the utilities will make a strong case for additional charges,"" said Bergey, who said he will fight a proposed utility tariff. ""What the industry is concerned about is they’ll play up the cost ... and ignore the benefits."" Some observers look to what happened in Arizona as a sign of what could come next. There, a utility proposal backed by conservative groups to charge solar customers $50-$100 per month was whittled down to about $5 by the commission. And that executive order? Fallin’s executive order insisted the bill ""does not mandate tariffs or other increases for distributed generation customers."" Fallin told state agencies to implement the bill in accordance with her energy plan, ""which promotes wind and solar power as important forms of clean energy,"" and for the commission to ""consider the use of all available alternatives, including other rate reforms such as increased use of time-of-use rates, minimum bills, and demand charges."" The executive order isn’t binding, but it provides guidance to the Corporation Commission. Commissioners are elected statewide while vacancies are filled by the governor. ""This will be given all the attention that any changes in rates are given,"" said Mike Skinner, the Corporation Commission spokesman. Still, Fallin’s order is music to solar advocates’ ears. ""Even without the executive order, the bill is just ambiguous and does not mandate any charge,"" Miller said. ""But the executive order lends a lot of clarity to that."" We checked in with TUSK, or Tell Utilities Solar won’t be Killed, a pro-solar group led by Republicans Barry Goldwater Jr., a former California congressman, and Tom Morrissey, former chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. TUSK consultant Jason Rose called Fallin’s executive order indicative of ""Republican adults"" who support customers’ rights to use solar to defray electric costs. ""Do I think (Maddow’s) assessment of the legislative effort was accurate? Yes, I do,"" Rose said. ""Was she unaware, or were her producers unaware, of the executive order that neutered the legislation? Yes."" Our ruling Maddow said, ""Oklahoma's Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee. It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power."" The law does not make you pay a special fee for using solar power, as Maddow said. What it does do is open the door to a potential fee -- if utility companies can prove that solar and wind customers are being subsidized by other energy consumers. We’re a ways from knowing whether the utilities can make their case and what fee might be assessed. The law does not affect the ability of Oklahoma solar and wind customers to sell excess energy they produce to lower their monthly bill, and even advocates of solar energy say Maddow’s segment missed news in Fallin’s executive order, which stressed ""this bill does not mandate tariffs or other increases"" for people who generate alternative energy. Maddow’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

154,pomt-09442,"""When we started this health care debate a year ago, 85 percent of the American people had health insurance, and 95 percent of the 85 percent were happy with it.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/10/george-will/will-says-95-percent-people-health-insurance-are-s/,"As the debate over health care reform moves slowly toward a climax, Republicans and other critics have argued that the public has made clear its opposition to the Democratic approach. On the Feb. 21, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, conservative columnist George Will -- a critic of the plan backed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats -- cited poll figures about Americans' satisfaction with their own health coverage. ""When we started this health care debate a year ago, 85 percent of the American people had health insurance, and 95 percent of the 85 percent were happy with it,"" Will said during the show's roundtable discussion. ""So there was no underlying discontent that you now postulate to drive this radical change."" We thought it would be worth checking whether Americans are really so enthusiastic about their health coverage. First, we'll dispatch with Will's claim that 85 percent of Americans had health insurance. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the leading arbiter of the number of uninsured Americans, Will is exactly on the mark. In the last Census Bureau study, 255.1 million Americans had health insurance in 2008, while 46.3 million did not. That's 84.6 percent, or rounding up, 85 percent -- just as Will said. Now, for the polling data. We were able to find eight surveys taken in 2008 and 2009 that asked Americans whether they were satisfied with their health coverage. We ruled out poll questions that asked about satisfaction with the costs of health care, which we decided goes beyond the scope of Will's comment. To conform with Will's formulation, we also ruled out polls that questioned people who lack insurance in addition to those who have it. Our two-year search period covers a longer time than Will's phrasing of ""a year ago,"" but doing so provides us with a much wider sampling of polls to choose from. Typically, the polls we located offered their respondents four or five possible choices. Most common was ""very satisfied,"" ""somewhat satisfied,"" ""somewhat dissatisfied,"" or ""very dissatisfied."" One poll, sponsored by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, added another category: ""extremely satisfied."" To determine whether respondents of a given poll were ""happy"" with their health insurance -- as Will phrased it -- we lumped together the percentages for ""very satisfied,"" ""somewhat satisfied"" and, where applicable, ""extremely satisfied."" Here's what we found, poll by poll, in reverse chronological order: • Quinnipiac University, Sept. 2009. ""How satisfied are you with your health insurance plan?"" 54 percent very satisfied, 34 percent somewhat. Total: 88 percent satisfaction. • Quinnipiac University, June 2009. ""How satisfied are you with your health insurance plan?"" 49 percent very satisfied, 36 somewhat satisfied. Total: 85 percent satisfaction. • ABC News/Washington Post, June 2009. ""For each specific item I name, please tell me whether you are very satisfied with it, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. ... Your health insurance coverage."" 42 percent very satisfied, 39 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 81 percent satisfaction. • Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, May 2009. ""Overall, how satisfied are you with your current health insurance plan?"" 21 percent extremely satisfied, 37 percent very satisfied, 30 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 88 percent satisfaction. • ABC News/Washington Post, June 2009. ""For each specific item I name, please tell me whether you are very satisfied with it, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. ... Your health insurance coverage."" 42 percent very satisfied, 39 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 81 percent satisfaction. • Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, Aug. 2008. ""Please rate your satisfaction with each of the following aspects of your health care. ... Quality of health care I receive through my (health insurance) plan."" 31 percent extremely satisfied, 41 percent very satisfied, 23 somewhat satisfied. Total: 95 percent satisfaction. • Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, Aug. 2008. ""Please rate your satisfaction with each of the following aspects of your health care. ... Overall satisfaction with my health (insurance) care plan."" 23 percent extremely satisfied, 38 percent very satisfied, 30 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 91 percent satisfaction. • Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, May 2008. ""Overall, how satisfied are you with your current health insurance plan?"" 17 percent extremely satisfied, 36 percent very satisfied, 33 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 86 percent satisfaction. If you average these eight scores, the total rate of satisfaction is 87 percent. In all but one poll, the satisfaction level was below Will's stated level of 95 percent. One poll, taken five months before Obama was inaugurated, did come up with 95 percent satisfaction. But alone among these eight polls, that survey asked participants about the ""quality of health care I receive through my (health insurance) plan."" While we decided that the wording was close enough to merit inclusion on our list, the modest difference in satisfaction levels may stem from the way the question was phrased. Many people feel more warmly toward their doctors than they do toward their insurers. So, while one poll with unique wording pegged satisfaction at 95 percent, the average of all relevant polls over a two-year period was eight points lower than what Will cited. However, Will is correct that the levels of satisfaction with one's own health insurance are consistently high. Indeed, they're extraordinarily high, when one considers how rarely surveys find such high levels of agreement among Americans. Since Will portrayed the larger point accurately, even while modestly overstating the number, we rate his comment Mostly True.",None,George Will,None,None,None,2010-03-10T18:58:11,2010-02-21,['United_States']
155,pomt-04964,"""Obamacare"" is the ""biggest tax increase in American history.""",false,/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/25/mark-neumann/biggest-tax-hike-us-history-obamacare-says-gop-us-/,"Among Republicans, if there’s a topic as hot as the record-breaking heat of the summer of 2012, it’s President Barack Obama’s health care reform law. ""I think it's the worst piece of legislation that's been passed in my lifetime,"" former Republican Wisconsin congressman Mark Neumann said. ""It's stopping business from growing and creating jobs. It's the biggest tax increase in American history, likely to bankrupt this country by spending $2.6 trillion; $500 billion taken out of Medicare; the list just goes on and on and on."" Neumann, who is running in the August 2012 primary for the U.S. Senate, went on at some length about his first TV ad -- which hits ""Obamacare"" -- during a July 10, 2012 interview with WTMJ-AM’s Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host in Milwaukee. But we’ll zero in on the boldest claim made by Neumann -- that the law is ""the biggest tax increase in American history."" Neumann’s evidence Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander cited a July 2010 article by FactCheck.org, a project based at the University of Pennsylvania. It concluded that ""as measured by the rather useless yardstick of raw dollars, with no adjustment for inflation,"" the Affordable Care Act could be the largest tax hike in U.S. history. At $76.8 billion in 2014, the law would be the largest one-year tax increase in raw dollars since 1968, FactCheck.org said, using U.S. Treasury data. But Neuman ignores what the article goes on to say: ""that attack is misleading, and the raw-dollar measure is a poor way to measure the size of a tax increase."" The reason is the simple fact of inflation, which means a dollar today is worth less than one years ago. Adjusting for inflation, a 1982 tax hike under GOP President Ronald Reagan is the largest tax increase ($85.3 billion), and Obama’s health reform law drops to fourth ($71.7 billion), FactCheck.org found. And using what it called the best yardstick -- the amount of revenue raised in one year as a percentage of gross domestic product -- the health law ranks as the seventh-largest tax hike since 1968. The article’s conclusion: ""There’s no way the ACA’s tax and other revenue increases come close to being the largest in U.S. history."" Englander also cited a Forbes opinion column that claims the reform law is the largest tax increase if both the premiums people pay for health insurance and the penalties paid by those who don’t get insurance are considered taxes. But premiums paid to insurance companies obviously are not the same as taxes paid to the government. (On July 24, 2012, Neumann claimed a new Congressional Budget Office analysis found the law will increase taxes by $100 billion ""more than anticipated."" But the analysis focused on the June 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the law, which had effects on Medicaid, but didn’t make major changes to tax provisions. The new analysis found, according to the National Journal, that the law is $84 billion cheaper and that repealing it would worsen the federal deficit by $109 billion over 10 years.) Other evidence Before the FactCheck.org article was published, our colleagues at PolitiFact National also did some digging in rating as Pants on Fire an even bolder claim by Rush Limbaugh -- that the reform law is ""the largest tax increase in the history of the world."" They found that the health law is tied for fifth among the largest tax hikes between 1968 and 2006 as a percentage of gross domestic product. That includes the law’s penalty for not having insurance. That makes Obama’s health law a big tax increase, but not biggest. Our rating Neumann said ""Obamacare"" is the biggest tax increase in American history.""

156,pomt-04843,"""We do know that Romney personally approved over $70 million in fictional losses to the IRS as part of the notorious 'Son of Boss' tax scandal, one of the largest tax avoidance schemes in history.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/13/barack-obama/obama-links-romney-infamous-tax-shelter/,"Barack Obama expanded his assault on Mitt Romney’s business ethics with a new ad that connects Romney to dodging taxes. The ad opens with a clip of Romney in an interview. Interviewer: Was there ever any year when you paid lower than the 13.9 percent? Romney: I haven’t calculated that. I’m happy to go back and look. Announcer: Did Romney pay 10 percent? 5 percent? Zero? We don’t know. But we do know that Romney personally approved over $70 million in fictional losses to the IRS as part of the notorious ""Son of Boss"" tax scandal, one of the largest tax avoidance schemes in history. Isn’t it time for Romney to come clean? If you haven’t heard of it, Son of Boss was a tax dodge that swept the country in the 1990s and allowed well-heeled investors and corporations to hide billions of dollars in taxes they owed the government. We thought we should examine this new allegation and see whether Romney truly did have a hand in advancing a spurious tax shelter. Marriott International and Son of Boss The substance of this claim goes to Romney’s years on the board of Marriott International. According to Bloomberg News, he joined the board of directors in 1993 and became head of the board’s Audit Committee, a position he held for six years. By this point, Romney had already established himself as a successful fund manager. His second year on the board, Marriott took advantage of a tax reduction method that Daniel Shaviro, a tax professor at the New York University School of Law, described to us this way: ""You and I purport to give each other, say $70 million. (But these cash flows are themselves largely fictional - e.g., I ‘borrow’ from you the money that I am ‘paying’ you). I then deduct the $70 million that I paid you, and don't include the $70 million that you paid me. End of story."" Complex partnerships, financial securities and the occasional offshore accounts were used to mask reality. The method went by the name of Son of Boss, named after a similar discredited tax scheme called BOSS, or Bond Option Sales Strategy. It was marketed aggressively by tax accountants nationwide, including some of the largest accounting firms. The Internal Revenue Service began cracking down in 2000. In 2008, the government estimated $6 billion in taxes had gone uncollected. A series of court decisions stated that the perpetrators were guilty of ""subverting the legislative purpose of the tax code by engaging in transactions that are fictitious or lack economic reality simply to reap a tax benefit."" Citing court documents, Bloomberg reported that in 1994, an investment banker faxed a proposal to a senior tax attorney at Marriott. By creating new partnerships, the company could post a paper tax loss without doing itself any real financial harm. This was Son of Boss in action. Through it, Marriott reported $71 million in losses that the courts ultimately decided did not exist. By the mid-2000s, Marriott was in court defending its use of this tax shelter. In 2008 it lost; the company appealed and lost again in 2009. Romney’s role The central question is, did Romney know what was going on and did he sign off? The ad relies on the opinion of two tax attorneys, Edward Kleinbard and Peter Canellos, who wrote that ""Romney approved the firm's reporting of fictional tax losses."" The authors go on to express their opinion that Romney had the expertise to understand the nature of the scheme and had the fiduciary responsibility to review it. There is only one certain fact about Romney’s role at Marriott. At some point, the board would have reviewed and accepted various financial filings and audit reports that included the tax losses claimed under Son of Boss. What we don’t know is whether the board or the audit committee specifically discussed the tax shelter itself, either before it was used or when it delivered the promised tax savings. On this point, we have no outright denial from the Romney campaign. We asked the campaign if Romney approved the use of Son of Boss and they referred us to Marriott International. At Marriott, Stephanie Hampton, senior director of global corporate communications told us, ""None of our directors has actively initiated or coordinated the company's tax planning strategies."" But this is no denial. Initiating and coordinating are not what board Audit Committees do. The ad claims that Romney approved the deal, not that he initiated it or coordinated it. Absent a denial, we enter the hazy world of the role of corporate board audit committees in 1994. ""The standards for audit committees compared to what we see now were more modest,"" said Joe Carcello, professor of accounting at the University of Tennessee. Carcello told us he is skeptical that company managers would have brought this transaction before the board at all. If they did, he expects the managers would have told board members, ""We vetted this with the tax lawyers and they say this is a legitimate transaction,"" Carcello said. ""Unless the audit committee had three or four tax lawyers, they wouldn’t have any reason to question it."" Accounting experts seem to share this view, but tax lawyers have a different opinion. The lawyers cited by the Obama campaign say by 1994, the New York State Bar had issued warnings about tax shelters of this sort. Shaviro at New York University told us there would be ample reason to question the transaction. The company was claiming a large loss but it wasn’t actually losing any money. To Shaviro, the follow ups would be obvious: ""Can this really work? Do the tax lawyers agree? Is it too good to be true?"" Linda Beale, a professor at Wayne State Law School, said, ""The audit committee is the place to draw the line on improper behavior."" Romney seems to have taken his board duties seriously. Bloomberg cited a fellow Marriott board member, Gilbert Grosvenor, who said Romney examined the company financial statements closely. ""Certainly deeper than we did as members,"" Grosvenor told Bloomberg. Marriott International said the company ""takes prudent precautions, including seeking the advice of outside professionals, to ensure our tax strategy is consistent with Federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations."" It is important to note that in 1994, the federal government had yet to crack down on these tax schemes. Our ruling The Obama ad says Romney personally approved $70 million in fictional tax losses through the Son of Boss tax shelter. Marriott International used Son of Boss. At the time, the illegality of the scheme had not been proven in court, but the nature of it was clear to all participants. Romney was head of Marriott’s audit committee at the time. Experts disagree on whether the corporate board would have known about the deal and had the chance to question it. The company neither confirmed nor denied that the board approved the transaction. At some point, the board would have approved filings that included the fraudulent losses, but it’s unclear whether Romney specifically favored the tax move. The statement includes a measure of truth but ignores important context. We rate it Half True.",None,Barack Obama,None,None,None,2012-08-13T15:04:31,2012-08-09,['None']
157,pomt-12039,"The mobilization of the military in response to the storms in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands ""is the largest ever mobilization of our military in a naval and marine operation"" and an Air Force carrier there ""was the first-ever as well.""",mostly false,/florida/statements/2017/sep/14/tom-bossert/has-military-taken-unprecedented-action-response-h/,"President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said that the military has taken unprecedented steps in response to Hurricane Irma. By the time of this briefing Sept. 11, Hurricane Irma had weakened to a tropical storm as it made its way up the Florida peninsula. ""The mobilization of our military in response to the storms in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is the largest ever mobilization of our military in a naval and marine operation, and we now have an Air Force carrier deployed in this effort; this was the first-ever as well,"" Bossert said. Was the military’s response to Irma the largest naval operation ever and the first time an aircraft carrier has been deployed after a natural disaster? For one, the Navy actually operates aircraft carriers, not the Air Force. More to the point, it is too soon to say that the U.S. response to Irma was the largest response to a hurricane, and it definitely was not the first time an aircraft carrier was deployed for that reason. Military response to Hurricane Irma is significant, but it’s too soon to say it’s the largest ever Hurricane Irma struck the U.S. Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm and skirted along Puerto Rico’s coast with 185 mph winds. The storm continued on a track towards Florida, where it hit the Keys as a Category 4 hurricane in the Florida Keys and then again on Marco Island as a Category 3. The storm caused major, widespread damage from Miami to Naples to Tampa and Jacksonville. In response to Irma, the Defense Department said on Tuesday that it had dispatched 10,000 service members to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and 20,700 in the eastern United States. The National Guard reported Sept. 12 that it had deployed more than 15,500 guardsmen in response to Irma. In addition to service members, the Pentagon has deployed nine ships and the USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier controlled by the Navy. These numbers could change as the department assesses what is needed. Still, by numbers alone, the response to Irma at the time of this claim doesn’t quite stack up against the Pentagon’s response to Hurricane Katrina. By Sept. 7, 2005, nine days after Katrina made landfall, operations included 17,417 active-duty troops, 42,990 National Guardsmen, 20 U.S. ships, 360 helicopters and 93 military planes, according to a Congressional Research Service report. ""Whether the Irma efforts become the largest deployment of U.S. military forces after a natural disaster remains to be seen, but it’s worth noting that more than 12,000 Department of Defense personnel assisted with Unified Assistance, and thousands were deployed after Hurricane Katrina,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. More broadly, if you consider all naval and Marine operations (not just hurricane relief), then Bossert’s claim is even more inaccurate. ""Clearly this was nowhere near the biggest naval/Marine operation ever—it was dwarfed by big wartime operations from World War II and the Korean war and even Operation Desert Storm,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Is this the first time the United States has deployed an aircraft carrier? The Navy Office of Information confirmed that this was not the first time an aircraft carrier has been deployed to help hurricane recovery efforts. After Hurricane Katrina, the USS Harry S. Truman deployed for rescue and recovery operations. In addition, the USS Saipan was deployed after Hurricane Hazel in 1954. And it’s not only hurricanes. In 1959, the USS Kearsarge deployed to Japan to help with relief efforts related to Typhoon Vera. The USS Abraham Lincoln was also sent to Sumatra to provide support for Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Bossert said the Defense Department had put together ""the largest-ever mobilization of our military in a naval and Marine operation."" He also added that for the first time ever an ""Air Force carrier"" had been deployed in the effort. Bossert misspoke when he said ""Air Force"" carrier, but it’s still not the first time an aircraft carrier has been used after a natural disaster. Most importantly, it is too soon to say that the military response to Hurricane Irma was the largest ever. At this point, the response to Irma doesn’t quite stack up against the Pentagon’s response to Hurricane Katrina. We rate this claim Mostly False.

158,pomt-07979,"Under federal law, Jared Loughner ""would not have been able to buy a gun"" had he been identified as mentally ill.",mostly true,/ohio/statements/2011/jan/20/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-laments-system-failure-allowed-j/,"Jared Loughner, the 22-year-old Tucson man accused of killing six people and injuring 13 others including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, scared community college classmates even before his alleged rampage. He should have been diagnosed, treated and kept in a mental health institution as long as he was a danger to others, or so goes the national conversation. But that never happened. And the shameful irony is that under a bill that President George W. Bush signed, ""if he had been identified with this mental illness, he would not have been able to buy this gun,"" U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown said in a discussion of the mental health safety net during an appearance on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" program. ""I mean, the laws were there, but he fell through the system, he fell through the cracks, because he wasn’t identified because when he left the community college, nobody approached him, apparently."" The system’s failure will be discussed by others for some time, but Brown, an Ohio Democrat, caught our attention for his other point on the Jan. 11 TV segment -- that ""laws were there"" already to prevent Loughner from buying a firearm, if only he had been diagnosed. So we checked with the FBI, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the Ohio attorney general’s office, a group called Legal Community Against Violence and the Buckeye Firearms Association, a pro-Second Amendment group. There was no disagreement: A federal law passed in 1968 made it illegal to possess a firearm if you had been found by a court or legal authority to be a ""mental defective."" The prohibition also applied to anyone involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Enforcement was strengthened with the Brady Handgun Protection Act of 1993, which established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to conduct electronic background checks when individuals purchase guns. Another measure, signed by President George W. Bush, improved the reporting system as it pertained to mental health issues after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. Individuals may be released from the federal gun ban if they have deemed rehabilitated and are discharged from all monitoring. Under Arizona law, it would not have been hard to get Loughner committed, according to reviews by news organizations. ""Arizona has one of the least restrictive laws when it comes to detaining apparently mentally ill people against their will,"" Reuters, a wire service, reported on Jan. 13. ""Under the state's broad involuntary-commitment statute, the government can mandate in-patient treatment for anyone determined to be ‘persistently or acutely disabled.’ That could include a broad range of seemingly troubled individuals."" But the federal gun law has exceptions. The big one: Those who voluntarily get institutional treatment and bypass the need for court action aren’t barred from gun ownership, according to the groups with which we checked. That means that if community college officials, counselors or Loughner’s parents had convinced Loughner to check in on his own, he still would have qualified to buy a gun. ""Just being mentally ill is not going to be the triggerer"" for the prohibition, said Becca Knox, the Brady Center’s director of research. For reasons that most agree are good, this country doesn’t keep a registry on mental illness. Mental illness is stigmatized enough already, and the majority of people who seek treatment ""will never commit a crime,"" said Jim Irvine, chairman of the Buckeye Firearms Association. ""We have talked about this and looked at it, and none of us at Buckeye have come up with a good solution. I don’t know how you deal with it, because you will have problems on all sides."" Yet there’s another problem, gun control advocates say. Some people who have been forced into psychiatric treatment by state courts -- and therefore have a record at the state level -- still don’t show up in the NICS system. Only 26 states have statutes authorizing or mandating that their mental health adjudications be sent to the federal system, according to the Legal Community Against Violence. Arizona does not have such a law, but it is one of nine states that provide the information to NICS anyway, said Robyn Thomas, executive director of Legal Community Against Violence. Ohio, too, provides the information voluntarily -- but it didn’t until the state passed a concealed carry law that took effect in 2004, according to Toby Hoover, executive director of the Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence and a Brady Center board member. This was confirmed by Lisa Peterson Hackley, spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. The bill that Bush signed provided financial incentives for all states to participate, but no federal laws make participation mandatory. So we come back to Brown’s claim that if Loughner ""had been identified with this mental illness, he would not have been able to buy this gun."" Brown’s statement was generally correct. We’ll concede that Brown was speaking as a guest on a fast-moving TV program where four other people were jumping in with opinions -- not exactly a forum for discussing the nuances of federal gun law. Nevertheless, his statement lacked the caveat that if Loughner had been diagnosed but had committed himself voluntarily and was not adjudicated by a court, he still could have bought a gun legally. That’s a point of clarification important for a full understanding of his statement. We rate his claim Mostly True.

Rather, Kyrillos said, he wants to lower taxes to stimulate growth. ""Well, we're going to have to raise revenue and I want to do it through growth. I want to lower tax rates. I want to make sure that America doesn't have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, which is what we have now, and lower the rates for everybody,"" Kyrillos said during a debate tonight with his Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, that aired on NJTV. Are corporations in the United States subject to the highest tax rate in the world? The statutory rate for businesses is the highest among industrialized nations. But for the rate businesses actually pay -- what’s called the effective tax rate -- the United States ranks among the highest, but not at the very top, according to studies. We checked a nearly identical claim that Kyrillos made during an Aug. 20 interview on WOR-AM. Then he said, ""we've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world."" We rated that statement Mostly True. At that time, a spokeswoman for Kyrillos cited the nation’s top statutory corporate tax rate of 39.2 percent. That rate is a combination of federal, state and local tax rates before any tax breaks are factored in. Japan used to have a higher statutory rate than the United States. But in April, Japan reduced its rate and the U.S. took first place among industrialized nations, according to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. So on that point, Kyrillos is right. Since businesses receive a number of tax breaks, the effective tax rate for corporations in the U.S. isn’t the world’s highest, but it’s still up there. More than a dozen of the most recent studies on effective corporate tax rates across the world found businesses in the U.S. paid an effective rate between 23 percent and 34.9 percent, according to a September 2011 report from the Tax Foundation. The effective rate varied between the studies the Tax Foundation looked at because of different methodologies. In those studies, the U.S. never ranked first in the world. But in 10 of the studies, the nation’s effective corporate tax rate ranked among the top five highest. It’s worth noting that an analysis by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that 30 Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn’t pay any federal corporate income taxes over the 2008-2010 period. As for what is the better measure -- statutory rates or effective rates -- we found mixed views. Scott Hodge, the president of the Tax Foundation, told PolitiFact New Jersey in August that because statutory rates are fixed they make for better comparisons, whereas effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries. But Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said ""effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens."" Then Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in an e-mail that ""both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax."" Our ruling Kyrillos repeated a claim he made before that the United States has the ""highest corporate tax rate in the world."" That’s true for the nation’s statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. When Japan lowered its statutory rate, the United States moved into first place. Even when accounting for various tax breaks, the effective rate is still among the highest. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate this statement Mostly True.

Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/06/donald-trump/trump-claims-un-sanctions-cost-north-korea-over-1-/,"President Donald Trump applauded a new resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against North Korea and labeled it as the largest economic punishment yet on the nation. ""The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!"" Trump tweeted Aug. 5. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com He detailed the impact in a follow-up tweet: ""United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K."" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump has sought China’s help to deal with security threats from North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and has called on other nations to join the United States in implementing sanctions against North Korea. On Aug. 5, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution to prohibit certain exports from North Korea, among other economic restrictions. We wondered if Trump accurately assessed the resolution and its impact. We found that Trump was largely right about the resolution’s provisions, but experts cautioned that the true financial impact of the sanctions depend on future enforcement by member nations. We reached out to the White House but did not hear back. U.N. Resolution 2371 On Aug. 5, the 15 nations that make up the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2371 (2017) to place new sanctions on North Korea. The resolution comes after North Korea’s most recent ballistic missile launches, in violation of a ban on nuclear and missile tests. The new U.N. resolution says: • North Korea shall not supply, sell or transfer coal, iron, iron ore, seafood, lead and lead ore to other countries; • UN Member States shall not increase the number of work permits for North Korean nationals (unless approved by the Security Council Committee), based on concerns that their earnings support North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs; • States shall prohibit the opening of new joint ventures or cooperative entities with North Korean entities and individuals, or the expansion of existing joint ventures through additional investments. The resolution also identified nine individuals and four entities that would become subject to a travel ban and asset freeze. The asset freeze extends to the Foreign Trade Bank, a state-owned bank that serves as North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank. Provisions in the resolution could reduce North Korea’s revenue by about $1 billion, according to statements from delegates in the Security Council. The ban on exports from North Korea will prevent it from earning ""over a $1 billion per year of hard currency that would be redirected to its illicit programs,"" said a resolution fact sheet from the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The east Asian nation earns about $3 billion per year from export revenues, the fact sheet said. Trump’s tweet on the gravity of the sanctions echoes what Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the resolution passed. ""This resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime,"" Haley said Aug. 5. ""The price the North Korean leadership will pay for its continued nuclear and missile development will be the loss of one-third of its exports and hard currency. This is the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation."" The United Nations has passed multiple other resolutions against North Korea in condemnation of its ballistic missiles tests. A November 2016 resolution restricted exports of coal from North Korea and banned copper, nickel, silver, and zinc exports. That resolution estimated cuts of at least $800 million per year to North Korea’s revenues. Whether the Aug. 5 sanctions have the weight Trump and Haley professed depends on enforcement by other nations, experts told us. The latest sanctions ""could be the biggest economic sanctions resolution imposed on North Korea, measured in the amount of hard currency provided to the regime — IF enforced,"" said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia and director of the China Power Project for Center for Strategic and International Studies. The claim that the United Nations sanctions would cost North Korea more than $1 billion is based on the assumption of ""full and perfect"" enforcement by all member states, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, associate scholar at Foreign Policy Research Institute and co-editor of North Korean Economy Watch. ""Judging by previous sanctions rounds (and sheer logic) this is virtually impossible and extremely unlikely because China tends to be lax in enforcement even of resolutions against North Korea that it votes in favor of,"" Katzeff Silberstein said. In a post for North Korean Economy Watch, Katzeff Silberstein noted that if a previous resolution had already been implemented in full, ""North Korea’s export revenues would already have been badly hit."" Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K."" The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 5 passed a resolution to sanction North Korea in response to its ballistic missile tests. The resolution bans the country’s export of coal, iron, iron ore, seafood, lead and lead ore to other countries; freezes assets of certain entities and individuals; and prevents other nations from increasing the number of work permits to be issued to North Korean nationals. Overall, the sanctions could represent about $1 billion in costs to North Korea — but experts say that greatly depends on other nations’ full enforcement of the sanctions.

162,pomt-04198,Says real estate taxes were put in place to pay for Obamacare.,mostly false,/texas/statements/2012/dec/06/todd-hunter/todd-hunter-says-obamacare-funded-real-estate-taxe/,"A South Texas legislator opposed to the federal health care overhaul signed into law by President Barack Obama doesn’t like how the law came to be. State Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, was asked during a Nov. 26, 2012, Texas Tribune event what he favors in state health care reform. Hunter replied: ""The first thing I prefer is transparency,"" adding that in his view, doctors, nurses and the people weren’t included in writing the federal act. ""And when you have amendments where Nebraska gets exempted from the taxation and then today we’re finding out you have real estate taxes being placed to pay for this?"" Hunter said. ""Actually, the biggest problem is how it was handled,"" Hunter said. First, let’s weigh the Nebraska exception. By email, Hunter told us he was referring to the so-called ""Cornhusker Kickback,"" which was a 2009 deal resulting in the Senate-approved version of the health care act giving Nebraska added federal Medicaid funds, as recapped by FactCheck.org in a December 2011 review. At the time the amendment was accepted, U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, declared he would vote for the overall proposal. However, the Nebraska provision was removed before the legislation passed into law, FactCheck noted. In turn, ""all states ended up with more federal funds, and they may well have Nelson to thank for it,"" FactCheck wrote. By phone, Hunter told us he had not said that the Nebraska amendment stuck in the plan because he didn’t know whether it did. He said he mentioned the amendment to demonstrate the deal-making that went on. In any event, his Nebraska reference could be taken as vague. So we’re focusing this fact-check on whether real estate taxes were put in place to fund Obamacare. Hunter pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2012, Forbes.com blog post by Michael Chamberlain, a personal financial planner. Headlined ""Will You Pay the New Obamacare Tax,"" the post says a surtax in the law means couples with incomes over $250,000 a year and singles earning more than $200,000 could see their taxes increase in 2013. He also nudged us to an undated publication on the tax from the National Association of Realtors, which says in part that the ""tax WILL NOT be imposed on all real estate transactions, a common misconception."" Indeed. In February 2011, PolitiFact debunked a claim that under Obamacare, all real-estate transactions would be subject to a 3.8 percent sales tax. That statement, rated Pants on Fire, is deceptive because a Medicare tax on investment income created under the law applies to the investment income of single taxpayers who make more than $200,000 or couples who make more than $250,000. (It’s spelled out in Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled ""Unearned income Medicare contribution."") That seems worth stressing. The tax would only apply to very high earners, accounting for no more than 2 percent of taxpayers, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Tax Policy Center, told us by telephone. For them, he noted, the tax would apply to the lesser of how much the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds the $200,000/$250,000 threshold or the amount that their investment gains exceeds the relevant threshold. And which investments might be subjected to the tax? According to the Internal Revenue Service, the Net Investment Income Tax applies, starting in 2013, to investment income for those very high earners from interest, dividends, capital gains, rental and royalty income and certain annuities plus income from businesses involved in trading financial instruments or commodities and businesses that are ""passive activities to the taxpayer,"" meaning they're held for the purposes of gradual long-term appreciation. Williams said he calls the tax an investment tax. ""When somebody says ‘real estate tax’ to me, I don’t think of the capital gains tax on real estate sales. I think of the property tax"" levied by local and state governments. ""This"" new tax ""has nothing to do with property taxes,"" Williams said. Separately, a director for the Washington-based Tax Foundation, which says it seeks sound tax policy, said the group does not call the tax a real estate tax. Joe Henchman said by phone: ""I imagine calling it a real estate tax could scare a lot of people, unnecessarily. Everyone is going to think it applies to them when 99 times out of 100, it won’t."" While few property owners would be affected in the tax’s early years, the foundation said in a Sept. 24, 2010, blog post that more home sellers could be hit as years pass because the tax changes were not indexed for inflation. PolitiFact has previously pointed out that homeowners will not be socked by the tax even if they make sales profits of hundreds of thousands of dollars. That’s because there’s a long-standing tax exemption on the profits from home sales. To be hit with the investment tax, you would have to clear more than $250,000 in profit off your home, which means at least $250,000 more than you paid for it. The ceiling is higher for a married couple. Married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit from home sales. And again, that's profit, not the sales price. Finally, we wondered how much total revenue the tax is expected to produce. Williams suggested we consider research by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which assists members of Congress on tax policy. The panel’s March 20, 2010, fiscal analysis of the health care law says that combined with a change in law stepping up payroll tax contributions by high-income taxpayers, the investment tax is expected to raise $210 billion from 2010 through 2019, a little under half of $438 billion in net revenue attributed to the overall law. Hunter later said he didn’t intend to scare anybody with his comment. ""We do need to make sure folks know how complicated this deal is,"" Hunter said. Our ruling Hunter said real estate taxes were put in place to pay for Obamacare. That’s an incomplete characterization, potentially leaving the misimpression we’ll all be ponying up every time we sell a property. In reality, the tax helping to fund the health care law is an investment tax solely affecting the very wealthiest taxpayers and then only touched off by super-sized profits from any of a variety of investment types. Real estate (including rents) fits into the big mix, giving the claim an element of truth. We rate it as Mostly False.",None,Todd Hunter,None,None,None,2012-12-06T16:00:00,2012-11-26,['None']
163,pomt-11210,"A ""catch and release"" immigration policy ""is a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown, this is a Democrat rule.""",false,/ohio/statements/2018/may/11/donald-trump/ohio-trump-misleads-blaming-democrats-catch-and-re/,"President Donald Trump called the nation’s immigration laws a ""disgrace"" and pointed the finger at Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, for the policy he calls ""catch and release."" ""You've seen catch and release,"" Trump said. ""You catch them and then you release them, okay? That's what it is. This is a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown, this is a Democrat rule, catch and release. You catch them, you release them."" Trump said that the undocumented immigrants then wait a year for a hearing and don’t show up in court. Trump made his comments at a tax roundtable in Cleveland on May 5, a few days before U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci won the GOP primary to challenge Brown in November. We found Trump’s talking point that ""catch and release"" is a ""Democrat rule"" wrong. In fact, the underlying policy has continued under his own administration. ""For decades, across both Democratic and Republican administrations, many immigrants apprehended while trying to enter the country (by land or sea) have been released from custody while their legal right to remain in the United States was being resolved by the courts,"" said Adam Cox, a New York University law school professor. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com History of 'catch and release' under Bush and Obama ""Catch and release"" refers to immigration authorities detaining undocumented immigrants but releasing them while they wait to appear before an immigration judge. The practice didn’t start during a Democratic administration, said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a George Mason University political science professor. On the contrary, the roots can be traced back to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2001 during the Republican administration of George W. Bush. The court ruled in Zadvydas vs. Davis that the government couldn’t indefinitely hold individuals beyond six months if it’s unlikely that ICE can actually deport them soon. The Bush administration eventually responded to the court order by increasing detention bed space and expanding ""expedited removal,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Under expedited removal, apprehended undocumented immigrants are detained and quickly go before an immigration agent. But in reality, the policy of releasing immigrants awaiting hearings didn’t end. Senate Republicans made attempts to stop the practice during Obama’s administration, but the process continued. Two key groups that have been exempted from expedited removal are those seeking asylum and undocumented minors. Those two groups soared during Obama’s tenure. A bill signed by Bush, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, codified the process for the treatment of undocumented minors. 'Catch and release' under Trump In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order to terminate ""catch and release."" In reality, it didn’t change actual policy. In an October Senate hearing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said ""catch and release"" was not official policy but was still happening due to a long backlog of cases and a shortage of immigration judges. ""It's just the reality that there are so many people claiming and being entitled to hearings that we don't have the ability to provide those hearings, and they are being released into the community, and they're not coming back for their hearings,"" Sessions said. The White House said that as a result of existing law, more than 107,000 unaccompanied minors had been released since fiscal year 2016. The White House blamed Congress for not providing enough money for detention space. Brown played no particular role with 'catch and release' Trump singled out Brown, likely because Trump was speaking in Ohio, but we found no statements by Brown about ""catch and release."" During the wave of unaccompanied minors in 2014, Brown called for ""comprehensive immigration reform."" Earlier this year, Brown supported amendments to boost border security and provide legal status for Dreamers, but the amendments didn’t draw enough support in the Senate to proceed. Brown’s campaign spokesman said that he has never voted or publicly commented on ""catch and release."" Our ruling Trump said the policy called ""catch and release"" is ""a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown, this is a Democrat rule."" Trump was referring to the practice of releasing apprehended undocumented immigrants while they await a hearing before an immigration judge. Trump misleads by labeling the policy a ""Democrat rule"" because it dates back to at least Republican President George W. Bush. Under Trump’s Republican leadership, the practice continues. A few factors are at play here, including lack of detention space and the laws about unaccompanied minors. But those factors aren’t in the hands of Democrats alone. Trump also singled out Brown, the Ohio senator, with no evidence that he played any role in the policy. We rate this claim False.

164,pomt-07787,"""75 percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business. They are not created by huge corporations and those who are very wealthy.""",mostly true,/ohio/statements/2011/feb/21/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-says-small/,"The term ""small business"" covers a range of seven different size categories, ranging from a two-person mom-and-pop grocery store to a factory with nearly 500 employees. Which is why researchers at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics chuckled when we asked them about a statement Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder made about small businesses creating new jobs. Appearing on WCPN 90.3 FM’s ""Sound of Ideas"" program, Batchelder noted the importance of small businesses in Ohio’s economy. ""Seventy-five percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business. They are not created by huge corporations and those who are very wealthy,"" Batchelder said. PolitiFact Ohio thought that sounded interesting and we put the Truth-O-Meter to work. We started by contacting the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Researchers there cited statistics that showed 99 percent of all private sector companies in the United States are considered small businesses, according to the definition used by the Small Business Administration. It categorizes any firm that employs 499 or fewer people as a small business. Traditionally, the number of people employed by small businesses has been about the same as the number who work for businesses of 500 people or more, said Brian Headd of the SBA’s Office of Advocacy. That category would include large factories, like auto plants and steel manufacturers. As of last year, the majority of workers had tipped toward small businesses, which employed just under 55 percent of the nation’s workforce, the BLS’s most recent statistics showed. We also checked with Batchelder’s office about the source of the speaker’s statement. Spokesman Mike Dittoe gave us two: The National Federation of Independent Business’s Ohio office in Columbus, and a March 2010 report prepared by Headd titled, ""An Analysis of Small Business and Jobs."" Roger Geiger, NFIB/Ohio’s executive director, both confirmed Batchelder’s statement and also referred us to the Headd report. Headd also echoed Batchelder’s sentiment that small businesses are important to the nation’s economic health. He points out how one in five employees at small firms work part-time, and how a greater percentage of Hispanics, high school students, disabled, elderly, and rural employees work at small businesses. Headd also noted that more than half of all companies start out small, stay small and close after a few years, accounting for 85 percent of job turnover in the country -- which is not necessarily a bad thing. Headd considers the hefty job changes experienced in small businesses to be beneficial and a natural outgrowth of a healthy economy. ""Although job turnover can be an emotional roller coaster for individuals, small firm job flows are a boon to the economy,"" Headd wrote in his report. ""This churning represents the economy’s constant evolution from outmoded processes and industries to more productive ones,"" a process he calls ""creative destruction."" Headd sees small businesses as key to the nation’s recovery from the recession of 2009. ""With the labor market struggling in recent years, small businesses are a logical group to look to for job recovery as they have such a large role in net job creation,"" he wrote. BLS researchers confirmed that their most recent statistics indicated that 75 percent of all new hires nationwide were made by small businesses in the second quarter of 2010. Over the past eight years, small businesses made 65 percent of all new hires in the United States, they said. And of small business job creation, nearly three out of four new workers were hired at companies with less than 20 employees. But what about Ohio? Do the state’s small businesses mirror the national trend? Benjamin Johnson of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services had data from the federal government on the most recent statewide breakdown, by county, of the total number of workers employed in Ohio, but could not provide specific information to verify Batchelder’s claim that ""75 percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business."" Geiger, in the Ohio office of the National Federation of Independent Business, didn’t have Ohio-specific data either. And the BLS told us they didn’t track that data, either. But researchers there made a point of saying they were sure Batchelder’s statement was essentially correct. As one pointed out: 99 out of 100 employers are classified as small businesses, so saying 75 percent of all new jobs in Ohio are created by small businesses is hardly different than saying ALL businesses create ALL jobs. So the experts who deal with labor statistics back up Batchelder’s claim, but we also note that the absence of specific data on Ohio jobs is a point that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter we rate Batchelder’s statement as Mostly True.",None,William G. Batchelder,None,None,None,2011-02-21T11:45:00,2011-02-04,['Ohio']
165,pomt-00996,"""Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium.""",half-true,/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/06/tweets/scott-walker-wants-cut-college-budgets-13-and-spen/,"On Feb. 2, 2015, the day before Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his state budget, Twitter lit up with this claim: ""Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium."" The tweets were a copy-and-paste of a headline on an article by Think Progress, a liberal blog, that was posted the same day. It was an eye-catching claim that went too far. The cut The first part of the claim in the tweets is on target. More than a week before formally introducing his 2015-'17 budget, Walker revealed that he would propose cutting $300 million over two years from the University of Wisconsin System. Top officials in the system, which includes the University of Wisconsin-Madison flagship and 25 other four-year and two-year schools, said the plan likely would lead to layoffs. In exchange, the system would get more control over its budget and more freedom from state rules in its operations. Walker’s proposed cut -- $150 million for each year of the biennium, for a total of $300 million -- amounts to a 13 percent reduction in state aid for the UW System. That reportedly would be the largest cut ever. It’s worth noting that state funding accounts for $1.2 billion of the system's total budget of $6 billion. Walker’s cut in state aid would amount to 2.5 percent of the total budget. We won't know until mid-2015 whether the cut ultimately becomes part of the final budget approved by the Legislature. But there is no dispute that the $300 million reduction for universities is what Walker has proposed. The arena Money for a new basketball arena is more complicated. The owners of the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks are trying to assemble private and public financing to build a new arena. The total cost is projected at about $500 million. That is not the amount Walker is proposing to spend. Like the university cuts, Walker announced his arena proposal before making his official budget presentation. He offered $220 million in state bonding -- essentially a form of borrowing -- toward the cost of the arena. Debt payments on the bonds would be repaid from growth in the so-called ""jock tax"" -- income tax revenue from Milwaukee Bucks players, employees and visiting teams. The rest of the $500 million would come from the Bucks’ current owners, the team’s former owner -- retired U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl -- and possibly from the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County. Normally, the growth in jock tax revenue would go to the state’s general fund to help pay for things such as schools, roads and other public services. But the Bucks could leave town in 2017 if a new arena is not in place by the fall of 2017. That is a deadline set by the NBA, which could buy the team back from its owners. In other words, without a new Milwaukee arena, there might not be any jock tax revenue. So, Walker is proposing a diversion of $220 million from the state's general fund to the arena. (A footnote: Although the headline on the Think Progress article said Walker would spend $500 million on the arena, the article itself did make a reference to his plan for $200 million in bonds.) Our rating A slew of tweets claimed: ""Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium."" Walker's 2015-'17 state budget does propose cutting $300 million from the University of Wisconsin System over the two-year period. The governor also proposes, in the form of bonds, a state contribution for a new Milwaukee arena. But it wouldn't be $500 million -- the total cost of the arena -- but rather $220 million.

166,pomt-14242,"In every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, ""there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first.""",half-true,/florida/statements/2016/apr/13/alan-grayson/us-rep-alan-grayson-downplays-potential-punishment/,"U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson waved off a recent congressional report on his alleged ethics violations, arguing that the findings mean he’s practically in the clear. The Office of Congressional Ethics on April 5, 2016, released a report recommending that a House committee keep investigating Grayson. The Orlando Democrat, who is running for Sen. Marco Rubio’s soon-to-open seat, has been accused of improperly managing a hedge fund, not disclosing all his finances and conducting business deals with the federal government that would be conflicts of interest. So far, the House has not formed a new subcommittee to keep looking into the allegations. Grayson said in a conference call with reporters that is a sign he likely won’t have to face serious repercussions. ""In every single instance where there's been any formal sanction -— an expulsion, a reprimand or a censure of any member — in every one of those cases since the Office of Congressional Ethics was established, there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first,"" he said. He added that if the House Ethics Committee doesn’t form one of these panels, it usually will dismiss the complaint. ""What this does very likely represent is the end of the road regarding this particular inquiry,"" he said. We wondered whether Grayson was right that formal sanctions have only followed the creation of an investigative subcommittee. We found that Grayson has a point on the most severe types of punishments, but it doesn’t mean investigations (or potential penalties) have reached ""the end of the road."" There may yet be mileage to cover here. House rules Let’s look at how ethics investigations work. The Office of Congressional Ethics is an independent body in charge of reviewing misconduct charges by House members and their staffs. The House created the office in March 2008 after criticism that its own self-policing wasn’t working very well, and the new office began reviewing cases in February 2009. The office investigates complaints, then makes recommendations to the House Ethics Committee. The committee can act upon the office’s reports, and still has the power to start investigations on its own. Grayson cited as ""formal sanctions"" — expulsion, reprimand and censure — but those are punishments that Congress rarely metes out, to begin with. Expulsion is what it sounds like: A member is removed from the House by a two-thirds vote. It has only happened five times in the history of the chamber, all before the Office of Congressional Ethics was created. The last time was in 2002, when Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, was expelled after taking campaign funds for personal use. Pennsylvania Democrat Michael Myers was expelled in 1980 for accepting a $50,000 bribe during the FBI’s Abscam sting, and three other members were kicked out after the Civil War started, for disloyalty to the Union. Next is censure, when a majority of the House votes to admonish a member’s behavior. Usually this includes a public shaming of sorts, during which the censured member must stand in the middle of the House chamber while a resolution is read aloud. The most recent example is Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., who was censured in 2010 for 11 ethics violations. Those violations included misusing his office resources to solicit funds and not paying taxes on a vacation home. It was the 23rd time a member had been punished with a censure. Rangel’s censure did have an investigative subcommittee in the House Ethics Committee, because procedure in this case required it. The same is true for the formal reprimand, also decided by House vote following an investigation. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report, ""reprimand"" and ""censure"" were essentially interchangeable until ""reprimand"" was defined as a lesser punishment in 1976. Unlike a censure, there is no public humiliation component of a reprimand. In 2012, California Democrat Laura Richardson was reprimanded for making congressional staff work on her campaign. Her punishment included a $10,000 fine. It was the 10th formal reprimand since 1976. We’ll note the Office of Congressional Ethics doesn’t factor in here, because the House Ethics Committee started its own investigation into Richardson, without a referral from the office. Again, the committee did empanel an investigative subcommittee, because that’s the procedure. Craig Holman, a lobbyist with government watchdog Public Citizen, said Grayson ""is painting a false picture"" of how members of Congress are disciplined. The formal punishments outlined above require an investigative subcommittee, but House rules outline scads of other punishments that can be levied. These other actions include fines, restitution, amending errant financial reports, removal from committees, loss of privileges or seniority or ""any other sanction determined by the Committee to be appropriate."" Holman said there’s been more than 20 of these cases since the OCE started. The House Ethics Committee is not necessarily bound to begin an investigative subcommittee in these cases. And even then, as sometimes happens in these cases, members can leave office rather than face an investigation (the committee only holds sway over House members). In 2011, Ohio Republican Jean Schmidt was ordered to repay $500,000 for free legal help without the House Ethics Committee starting an investigative subcommittee. She was not found guilty of knowingly violating House ethics rules. She repaid less than $50,000 before losing her re-election primary. There also isn’t always a set time limit for action, as Grayson implied. Instead of dismissing the complaint, the House Ethics Committee cited rule 18(a) in its conclusion to the OCE report on his case. That means the committee will keep the case open and may start an investigative subcommittee later. Sometimes that can mean much later. For example, the committee invoked rule 18(a) in August 2012 for Rep. Rob Andrews, D-N.J. An investigative subcommittee didn’t come until six months later, in March 2013. Andrews resigned the following year, with the investigation still open. We also found one other exceptional case that’s important to note. South Carolina Republican Joe Wilson was formally reprimanded in 2009 for interrupting President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address by shouting, ""You lie!"" That was through a resolution, not an ethics investigation. Wilson refused to formally apologize on the House floor after already apologizing to Obama personally. The Democrat-led House voted 240-179 for the reprimand over his ""breach of decorum."" The vote was largely seen as a political maneuver, not an outright ethics violation. Our ruling Grayson said that in every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, ""there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first."" The formal sanctions he cited were expulsion, censure and reprimand, all of which are exceedingly rare punishments. There are only three examples to pick from since the Office of Congressional Ethics materialized in 2009. In one case — the case of Wilson yelling ""you lie!"" — a formal reprimand came via a largely party-line resolution, not an ethics investigation, so no subcommittee was established. More importantly, Grayson omits that there are many other ways to discipline a member of Congress beyond formal sanctions. He also downplays that the House Ethics Committee kept his case open and could convene an investigative committee later.

168,pomt-06154,"""Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures"" on recall petitions.",mostly false,/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/18/maciver-institute/conservative-group-says-wisconsin-allow-mickey-mou/,"The Government Accountability Board, which oversees Wisconsin elections, met Dec. 13, 2011 to discuss petitions that are being circulated to recall Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Later that day, the conservative MacIver Institute posted a video report with a provocative headline: ""Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures."" Sounds daffy, even uber daffy. But similar reports appeared across the nation on sites such as Politico.com and FoxNews.com. Moreover, the Madison think tank’s video included a clip from the meeting in which Government Accountability Board members and staff talked about Disney’s most famous character and history’s most famous dictator. Would their signatures really be accepted on Walker recall petitions? A pivotal word here is accept. MacIver’s statement suggests that such signatures not only will be accepted by the state but also counted toward the more than 540,000 signatures needed to force a recall election in 2012. Indeed, the narrator in the video claimed the board had said all signatures listed with a Wisconsin address ""will be counted."" Two points emerged from the video’s clip of the discussion between a Government Accountability Board member and board staffers: 1. A signature with a name that does not include a Wisconsin address would automatically be stricken. A staff member noted that the name of Adolf Hitler was stricken from a petition submitted in the state Senate recalls in the summer of 2011 because the address listed was Berlin, Germany. 2. A signature bearing a name such as Mickey Mouse would not automatically be stricken if it is listed with a Wisconsin address -- but it would be ""flagged"" for additional review. The board has said each signature will initially be reviewed by two people -- staff members of the board or temporary workers hired to review the petitions. But, as we reported in a recent item about signing recall petitions multiple times, the board has said it will only do a general review of the names and that for a signature to be stricken it must be formally challenged by Walker. Walker and two tea party groups are assembling teams to review petitions for possible challenges. Some conservatives, however, fear it will be difficult to detect duplicate signatures and signatures for bogus but common-sounding names. (Two days after the video posting, Walker and the Republican Party of Wisconsin sued the board over its procedures, asking a judge to order the board, which is composed of six former judges, to look for and eliminate duplicate signatures, clearly fake names and illegible addresses.) We asked MacIver Institute spokesman Brian Fraley if he had evidence beyond the video to back the group’s claim. He said he did not. So, Mickey Mouse and Hitler signatures listed with an address in Wisconsin would be accepted in the sense that they would not be immediately rejected if spotted by GAB workers. But such signatures would actually be counted only if the apparently fictitious signatures went undetected -- by board workers, Walker representatives and other petition reviewers. Once detected, Walker could ask the board to strike those signatures. The board would decide the challenges at a public meeting. News reports about Mickey Mouse and Hitler signatures led the Government Accountability Board to issue a statement the next day about its process for handling ""potentially fictitious"" names. Two key points from the statement: 1. Recall committees have an incentive to strike fictitious names before submitting their petitions to try and ensure they have collected enough valid signatures. To be valid, a signature must be from a person who is qualified (though not necessarily registered) to vote in Wisconsin. Graeme Zielinski, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, has saidthe recall committees will strike obviously fictitious names. 2. In challenging signatures, Walker can submit evidence to back the challenges. And the Government Accountability Board can use resources such as voter registration lists in deciding whether to strike a signature. Our conclusion The MacIver Institute said ""Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures"" -- suggesting such signatures would automatically be counted toward the number needed to force Walker into a recall election. For such signatures to actually be counted, they would have to pass undetected through petition circulators, the recall committees, a pair of Government Accountability Board reviewers, Walker’s representatives and other groups that review the petitions. If such signatures were found, Walker could formally challenge them to the board to get them stricken. There’s an element of truth in MacIver’s statement in that fictitious signatures listed with Wisconsin addresses would be accepted -- but only for review.

169,pomt-14889,"""Our state has no major rivers to produce big hydropower.""",mostly true,/georgia/statements/2015/nov/10/tim-echols/wading-question-hydropower-georgia/,"Anyone who has ever visited Niagara Falls has a very clear idea of the power of water. But the same might be said about the Chattahoochee River for anyone who has ever decided to explore some of the whitewater. So a recent claim made by one member of the Georgia Public Service Commission, in touting the state’s commitment to nuclear power, caught our attention. ""Our state has no major rivers to produce big hydro power,"" Commissioner Tim G. Echols wrote in Power Engineering, a magazine that covers the power generation industry. ""What we do have is nuclear power, and it enjoys widespread support."" No major rivers? And what is ""big"" hydro? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check Who decides? We reached out to Echols, who cited both state and federal reports to back up his claim. The 2014 Georgia Energy Report by the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority said that hydroelectric generated 2 percent of power generation and 5.5 percent of capacity in 2012, Echols said. And a 1998 report for the U.S. Department of Energy evaluated ""undeveloped hydropower potential"" and found Georgia’s undeveloped hydropower potential was between about 613 megawatts and 1,137 megawatts of power. Large-scale hydropower is more than 30 megawatts in size. Each of the two nuclear units being built at Plant Vogtle, which we will get to in a moment, will generate about 1,117 megawatts each. ""So, if we extracted every last megawatt of potential hydropower that has been identified in Georgia, we would equal the output of a single nuclear reactor under the most favorable interpretation,"" Echols said. ""In a more realistic scenario, we could generate roughly 60 percent of that."" Rivers run through it Part of whether the statement makes sense falls on whether Georgia has any ""major"" rivers. As any elementary school student can tell you, many towns and cities developed alongside rivers throughout the nation’s history, with the waterways serving as transportation for people as well as goods. The Chattahoochee, Savannah and Suwannee are the major rivers in Georgia. The Hooch is the state’s longest, flowing about 435 miles. There are 13 dams along the Chattahoochee, designed to both regulate flow and generate hydropower. By comparison, 56 dams built exclusively for hydropower sit in the Columbia River Basin, which stretches for 1,240 miles. Hydropower supplies about half of the electricity used in the Northwest - about 8,664 megawatts a year. So, Georgia may have major rivers, by our own state standards, but those rivers may not necessarily be major in terms of water-power electric generation. Peach State energy Georgia, like many states, is in the midst of a big shift in how it generates that electricity. The move has been away from coal as the primary fuel and into cleaner, greener options. Years ago, Georgia Power committed to building two new nuclear reactors at its Vogtle site south of Augusta. The project is years behind schedule and well over budget but, once done, will allow nuclear to grow beyond the 9 percent of capacity it accounted for as of the third quarter this year, according to Georgia Power. Nuclear is small in capacity terms, especially compared to the 32 percent capacity from coal and 49 percent from natural gas. But it’s almost double the 5 percent capacity from hydropower, the electricity generated from 18 plants Georgia Power operates across the state. Capacity versus energy From that perspective, neither hydropower nor nuclear appears ""big"" energy generators. (In hydropower’s case, it’s not big relative to other regions of the country). But experts look not only at the capacity, or how much could be provided, but at energy, or what is actually generated to meet the need. Looking at it that way, hydro appears even smaller, accounting for 5 percent of capacity but just one percent of energy, said Georgia Power spokesman John Kraft. Nuclear, meanwhile, accounts for 9 percent of capacity but generated 19 percent of the energy in the third quarter. And, as we mentioned, Georgia Power has put its money behind nuclear. The company has not sought to build a new hydroelectric facility since the mid-1970s and last brought two units online in 2005 as upgraded replacements for long-used plants, Kraft said. ""Many of the prime hydroelectric generation locations in Georgia are now in use. In addition, the rivers that flow through Georgia originate in Georgia, therefore, their drainage basins are relatively small,"" Kraft said. ""The really large river systems such as the Columbia, Ohio and Tennessee include multiple states in their drainage basins and have much larger hydropower potential."" Outside view It’s not just the company that thinks so. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is one of the world’s largest suppliers of hydroelectric power. By the Corps calculations, Georgia Power has about 340 megawatts of capacity on the Chattahoochee and some smaller power generation elsewhere in the state. The Corps has another 350 megawatts of capacity on the Chattahoochee, too. But those plants are usually the ""last on, first off"" resources to meet demand. Nuclear plants operate continuously, making direct comparisons difficult, said spokeswoman Lisa Parker. ""I feel that Georgia does have major rivers that have been developed by USACE and GPC for peak hydropower,"" Parker said. ""It does not have major rivers that could support large base load hydropower, such as the Columbia River."" Still, the U.S. Department of Energy’s updated hydropower assessment found in 2014 that the south Atlantic-Gulf region, including Georgia, had untapped potential for another 2,561 megawatts of power. Our ruling In explaining Georgia’s support of nuclear energy, Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols wrote in a trade publication that the state has no ""major rivers to produce big hydropower."" In the most simple terms, Georgia does have major rivers where hydroelectric plants are a key part of the mix in meeting the state’s energy demands. As a percentage of power generation, hydropower is destined to remain a relatively small part of that mix given the limitations of our rivers compared to massive waterways in places such as the Pacific Northwest. There is some room for growth in hydroelectric, which Echols’ statement ignores, even if other energy sources will always dominate. We rate Echols’ statement Mostly True.",None,Tim Echols,None,None,None,2015-11-10T00:00:00,2015-10-26,['None']
170,pomt-02155,"Says gubernatorial candidate Clay Pell ""hasn't spent a dime on advertising.""",pants on fire!,/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/02/robert-walsh/neari-executive-director-robert-walsh-jr-says-cand/,"During an April 20, 2014, interview on WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers,"" Robert A. Walsh Jr., executive director of the National Education Association-Rhode Island, was asked about the likelihood that Clay Pell would win September's Democratic primary and, ultimately, the November election. Walsh downplayed the importance of the latest polls showing little support among Democrats for Pell, the gubernatorial candidate supported by the union. (Pell was favored by 9.4 percent in an April 11 Brown University poll and 15 percent in a February Providence Journal / WPRI survey.) ""Poll numbers in April for a relatively new candidate are meaningless,"" Walsh said. ""What is he? Mid-teens or something right now? But he hasn't spent a dime on advertising or done anything else. He's getting out there meeting people. When he meets people he converts them to his cause and his message."" Hasn't spent a dime on advertising? That didn't make cents to us. Immediately after Pell's announcement on Jan. 28, 2014, it was almost impossible to go online and not see ads for Pell popping up on nearly every website you’d visit -- even those featuring General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, one of Pell’s Democratic opponents. Those ads cost a lot of dimes, so we called Walsh to see if he could justify his claim. He responded by email: ""Of course the reference was to the traditional television buys that accompany campaigns (since I was on TV when I mentioned it),"" he wrote. That's not a distinction he made during the program. Exactly how much has Pell spent on advertising? On April 23 we began an effort to get that information -- even a rough estimate. Pell's campaign promised to get back to us, but despite repeated follow-up calls and emails, we couldn't get our questions answered. A week later, on April 30, the Pell campaign, as required by law, filed its quarterly finance report for the first three months of 2014. It showed that Pell, who began his campaign by loaning himself a million dollars, has now invested another million dollars of his own money in his campaign and spent $311,547 in January, February and March. It also showed that on Jan. 7, Pell spent $36,530 on advertising and media production through a media company in Washington, D.C. The firm got another $7,880 on March 10. (The other two items listed as advertising expenditures were $200 for an ad with the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society and $800 for a full-page ad in the program book of this year's Providence Newspaper Guild Follies, run by unionized workers at The Journal.) Our ruling NEARI executive director Robert Walsh said candidate Clay Pell ""hasn't spent a dime on advertising."" At the time, the Pell campaign had already spent 444,100 dimes, or $44,410, on advertising through a Washington media firm. We know the public has seen at least some of that money because we were inundated with online Pell ads soon after his announcement. To suggest that Pell hasn't spent a dime -- or a quarter, or a dollar -- on advertising is not only short-changing the truth, it's ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

171,pomt-03524,"Since Gina Raimondo took office, investment fees on the state's pension portfolio ""have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million.""",half-true,/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/02/frank-caprio/ri-treasurer-candidate-frank-caprio-says-pension-i/,"How much money should you spend to make money? That question, which every investor faces, has moved to the forefront in Rhode Island since the State Investment Commission, at the urging of General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, started moving 15 percent of state pension money into hedge funds. Those funds not only charge a very high fee for managing the account, they also collect a ""performance"" bonus -- often 20 to 25 percent -- from the profits. Raimondo's office says that's worth the price because hedge funds protect the pension fund from the type of drastic dip in value seen when the economy fell into a recession in 2008. Critics contend that investment expenses charged by those funds, combined with the risk they pose, make them a very bad choice. One such critic is Frank Caprio, who served as treasurer from 2007 through 2010 and, after an unsuccessful run for governor, is seeking his old job back. On the May 19 edition of the WJAR-TV program ""10 News Conference,"" Caprio said he worked hard as treasurer to reduce the fees paid by the pension fund. ""And lo and behold, after I left office, a national group did a study of all the pension funds. And Rhode Island ranked at the right end, the high end of that study, paying some of the lowest fees in the country, per capita,"" he said. ""The fee structure of hedge funds is much different than index fund managers, which are the type of managers we had a lot of money with. So the fees have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million,"" Caprio said. That's a big increase. We thought we'd check the numbers. We turned to both Raimondo's office and to Caprio. The former treasurer sent us the July 25, 2012, edition of the Maryland Policy Report, which ranked states based on the Wall Street fees they paid. For Rhode Island, it lists management fees of $13.1 million for the 2010 fiscal year. That's an expense ratio of $2.15 for every $1,000 invested. The U.S. average was $4.09 per $1,000. Only 10 other states paid a lower ratio. Raimondo's office, along with other documents, confirmed the $13.1 million figure, which is a bit higher than the ""about $12 million"" cited by Caprio. When we asked Caprio for the source of the $50 million comment, he referred us to minutes from the April 24, 2013, meeting of the state Investment Commission. Stephen Nesbitt, chief executive officer of Cliffwater LLC, one of the state's management consultants, is cited as saying that with the inclusion of performance fund hedge fees, the state is paying an expense ratio of 0.58 percent. That would be $5.80 for every $1,000 invested. Because the fund had $7.78 billion on April 30, that would equal $45.1 million in annual fees being paid, Caprio said. That's a bit lower than his ""about $50 million."" But these numbers don't begin to tell the whole story. The year cited by Caprio touting his own performance occurred during the financial crisis, when the value of the state's pension fund was depressed. For that reason alone, investment fees (also known as management and performance fees) would be lower. (The expense was $13.1 million for 2010, but it was $20.3 million the previous year and $28.6 million the year before that. Caprio said the big 2010 reduction ""was not because of market going down. My team moved over $2 billion out of active money managers who charged high fees to index funds that charge low fees."") Raimondo's office contends that such direct fees are actually lower under her current administration -- $12.7 million during the last fiscal year and $15.1 million the year before that. (Management fees cover the basic services for handling an account. They are calculated based on a percentage of what the fund is worth and paid whether the value of the fund has risen or fallen.) Yet it gets even more complicated. The direct management fees charged by traditional investments are only a small part of the actual cost of administering the state's portfolio. Other types of investments, such as those hedge funds, charge indirect fees, which are removed from the fund balance before it is reported, making them harder to compile. Hedge funds charge both an indirect management fee and an indirect performance fee, which is typically about 20 percent of the fund's profit, assessed annually. The total for the fees paid under Raimondo has tripled because the current treasurer, for the first time, has begun reporting both direct and indirect fees. It's one of only six states doing so, according to Cliffwater. How much are we talking about? In May, Raimondo's office released an accounting of all investment expenses for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012. They totaled $46 million, including staff expenses; $32.5 million of that went for indirect fund expenses and $13.5 million for direct fees. How high were the indirect expenses during the year Caprio was paying out $13.1 million in direct expenses? That's hard to tease out because they haven't been reported, and few states do. The bottom line: Raimondo contends they were higher than Caprio stated. Caprio disagrees. We can’t determine who’s right because they weren’t reported in past years. Our ruling Frank Caprio said that since Gina Raimondo took office, investment fees on the state's pension portfolio ""have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million."" State records show that, at first blush, the numbers were $13.1 million in 2010 and $46.0 million now. He's not on the money, but close. But it's not clear if Caprio has given a complete accounting of his expenses for fiscal 2010. Both Caprio and Raimondo say some data is unavailable for that year, so that element of truth remains unresolved. Because Caprio's comparison is partially accurate but lacks important details and elements of context, we rate it Half True.

172,pomt-08297,Says he has a track record of not raising taxes.,false,/texas/statements/2010/nov/01/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-he-has-track-record-not-raisin/,"Gov. Rick Perry says he's not overlooking any means of closing the state's widely expected revenue shortfall — except higher taxes, according to an Oct. 15 interview with the Texas Tribune. ""I think for anybody to stand up here and say categorically there's not going to be this or there's not going to be that —"" Perry started, before Evan Smith of the Tribune edged in: ""Well, you said it with taxes."" Perry's response: ""Well, but I've got a track record of that too. We don't raise taxes."" Later, Smith asked: ""So you don't believe that at any time that anybody reasonably could look over the last 10 years and identify anything where a tax went up?"" Perry agreed. We wondered whether Perry had accurately recited his track record as governor. After asking his campaign to elaborate, we took up a basic question: Has Perry signed tax hikes into law? Boy howdy, yes. Since becoming governor in late 2000, Perry has signed into law higher taxes on fireworks and cigarettes while also ushering into place a change in business taxation, according to the state comptroller's office. To get a handle on tax changes made early in Perry's governorship, we consulted a 2004 report from the comptroller's office that details the history of revenue-related bills that have become law from 1972 through 2003. Some notables from 2001, Perry's first legislative session as governor, and 2003: * House Bill 3667, which Perry signed into law on June 16, 2001, enacting a 2 percent tax on the retail sale of fireworks to help fund a rural volunteer fire department insurance fund. The new levy was projected to generate $848,000 over the next two years; it ended up raising about $1.4 million in that period. * Senate Bill 5, which Perry signed into law June 15, 2001, creating the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan Fund as part of an effort to help reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, which are air pollutants. Revenue for the fund was generated through ""several new charges,"" including a tax of 1 percent on the purchase or rental of diesel equipment. * House Bill 1365, signed by the governor on June 22, 2003, made tweaks in the emissions reduction fund to bring in more money. With the changes, the report says, the impact to the fund was projected to be $234.9 million in 2004-05. Austin consultant Billy Hamilton, who served as deputy comptroller under state Comptrollers John Sharp and Carole Keeton Strayhorn, told us that he doesn't think there was a tax increase per se in 2003. ""There were, however, several fee increases, and one school of thought is that fee is another word for tax,"" he said. We gauged Perry's tax record from 2004 to the present from other sources, including news articles and agency communications. In 2004, before a special legislative session, Perry laid out a plan to cut local school property taxes while generating new revenue in several ways, including through a $1-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes, a fee on admissions to topless bars, a statewide business property tax, and the closure of loopholes enabling some taxpayers to avoid the state's franchise and motor vehicle taxes, according to an April 2004 press release from his office. The plan went nowhere. Lawmakers returned to the school finance topic in a 2006 special session, engineering a tax overhaul that reduced local school property taxes. To help districts offset the loss of revenue, the Legislature revamped the franchise tax, increased the cigarette tax and modified how the state taxes used-car purchases. Perry signed the overhaul legislation into law in May 2006. A key goal of the new franchise tax, often called the margins tax, was to apply it to companies that had largely avoided the old corporate franchise tax. As expected at the time, businesses paid more in total after the overhaul of the franchise tax than before, although less than was forecast. Franchise tax revenue had totaled $5.8 billion in 2006 and 2007. In 2008 and 2009, the first two years of the revised tax, total revenue was $8.7 billion. However, the 2006 changes didn't affect all businesses the same way, said Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, which represents several hundred largely Texas-based businesses and legal and accounting firms. Because of the property tax reductions, some saw their taxes drop. Others had increases, he said. The $1-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes proposed by Perry in 2004 also was part of the 2006 tax changes; the $1.41-a-pack tax took effect in 2007. These increases alone generated $707 million in fiscal 2007 and $908 million in fiscal 2008. Lastly, the package required that the sale of used cars be taxed on a standard value ""rather than trusting sellers to report the true sales price,"" according to a May 15, 2006 news article from The Associated Press. The additional revenue from that change was $20.8 million for 2007 and 2008. Three tax increases? Sure. However, Perry has stressed that the 2006 increases shouldn't be counted against him because the cuts in local property taxes set in motion by lawmakers were bigger. Told by Smith on Oct. 15 that some people consider the franchise tax change to be an increase, Perry replied: ""That was a net tax decrease."" Craymer has a similar view. In an e-mail, he told us that the franchise tax change was a part of a package of bills ""that raised some taxes (franchise, cigarette, motor vehicle sales taxes) and lowered others (property tax) by much more."" Craymer shared a document with us based on the 2006 estimates of the impact of the tax changes; for each year from 2007 to 2011, it shows the property tax reductions as greater than the revenue generated by the other taxes. ""The new (franchise) tax never would have passed without the property tax cuts, so I don’t think it’s correct to try to look at it independently of the property tax cut,"" he said. Like Craymer, Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington-based group that collects pledges by officeholders and seekers not to raise taxes, says it doesn't consider tax swaps to violate the pledge. Spokesman Patrick Gleason told us the group's definition of a tax increase depends on the impact of a law. ""If it's revenue neutral or a net cut, that doesn't violate the pledge,"" he said. On Oct. 1, 2009, Perry signed the group's pledge for governors, which says that signatories will ""oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes."" Gleason said Perry hadn't previously signed the pledge. Tobacco users were hit again in 2009, when the Legislature decided to tax smokeless tobacco on weight rather than price, ""generating additional revenue of $105 million over two years,"" according to a May 28, 2009 Dallas Morning News news article. According to a December 2009 report from the Legislative Budget Board, some of the new revenue helps repay medical-school loans for doctors who agree to practice in underserved areas of the state. The rest was to be used to help offset franchise tax revenue that was lost when the Legislature temporarily exempted 40,000 businesses. Another tax that has jumped recently is the unemployment tax, which businesses pay quarterly to the Texas Workforce Commission to replenish the trust fund that ""provides unemployment insurance for Texas workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own,"" according to a Dec. 8, 2009 news release from the commission. Each year, the commission, whose members are appointed by Perry, sets a rate; it goes up if the balance in the trust fund is below a statutory level as of Oct. 1. According to a July 2009 news article in the Austin American-Statesman, ""unemployment taxes rise and fall with the economy, and, in fact, the tax rate fell steadily in Texas between 2004 and 2008."" However, the rate rose in 2009 and 2010, largely because of the impact of the economic downturn. In 2010, the increase in the minimum tax rate meant that most Texas employers would pay $64.80 per employee, compared with $23.40 the previous year. Craymer told us that the unemployment tax rate ""is set automatically based on the balance in the fund and is independent of any gubernatorial action."" We asked Hamilton about the big picture: Does he see tax increases during Perry's tenure? He said that depends on a person's perspective. ""There were significant tax increases for some taxpayers in 2006 with the cigarette tax and margin tax changes,"" he said. ""However, these are said to have been offset by reductions in school property taxes. In aggregate, that's true, but revenue neutrality is in the eye of the beholder. Some people wound up paying less, but some are paying more."" We never heard back from Perry on his tax track record. Upshot: Legislation, reports, news articles and expert analysis show that Perry has signed about half a dozen tax increases into law, including the three 2006 changes intended to help cover cuts in school property taxes. Texans paying more thanks to Perry's signature on tax-increase measures include companies with higher business taxes, plus cigarette smokers and purchasers of smokeless tobacco, fireworks and diesel equipment.

173,pomt-08648,"Allen West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and said ""this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it.""",false,/florida/statements/2010/sep/15/ron-klein/klein-says-west-called-social-security-ponzi-schem/,"What do you get when you mix a Democratic congressman facing a tough re-election battle, an outspoken Republican challenger famous for his rhetoric, and an NPR transcript of an interview with a journalist who recently found himself facing some heat for e-mail comments about conservatives? Those are the ingredients for a disputed TV ad. Here are the details: Allen West, the Republican challenging Democratic Rep. Ron Klein in District 22, is known for his unique and often controversial soundbites. As Klein faces West for the second time in two years in the closely Democratic-Republican split South Florida district, he is trying to use West's words against him by portraying him as extreme. In a Sept. 13, 2010, Klein TV ad, the announcer says: ""Allen West has extreme politcal views,'' and then quotes West speaking to a crowd saying: ""I'm just honored to be here today with all of my fellow right wing extremists."" (The ad doesn't state the location of that speech but the Klein campaign said it was from this July 2009 Broward County tea party event seen on YouTube.) The announcer then continues: ""Allen West called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He said this country has got to get on sound footing by destroying it. And West said that Medicare can be cut. Those aren't our values. Allen West. Too extreme for South Florida."" The text on the TV screen reads slightly differently in part from the voiceover: ""Allen West called Social Security a 'Ponzi scheme.' Allen West: said Social Security should be destroyed."" The text on the screen states that the source of those statements is NPR on Feb. 23, 2010. In this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore: Did West call Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and say ""this country has got to get on sound footing by destroying it?"" The district, which spans Broward and Palm Beach counties, has a heavy concentration of retirees so Social Security is a hot-button issue. First we turned to the Klein campaign to ask for their documentation for the ad. Spokesperson Melissa Silverman e-mailed us a transcript of a Feb. 23 NPR interview between NPR Fresh Air host Terry Gross and David Weigel, then a reporter for the Washington Independent, an online news publication. The name of the Fresh Air episode was ""CPAC, the Tea Party and the Remaking of the Right."" Weigel had attended both the Conservative Political Action Conference that had been held about a week before in Washington, D.C., and the National Tea Party Convention, which was held about one month prior to his NPR interview. Around minute 23 of the program, Gross asked: ""So is this a fair statement to make, that a lot of the Tea Partiers not only believe that taxes should be cut but that a lot of the programs that taxes pay for should be extremely cut or maybe even abolished, including Social Security and Medicaid, Medicare? "" Here was Weigel's response: ""That's absolutely true. And they'll put in some caveats about programs that people have paid into for a long time. But, you know, I talked to Allen West, who's kind of the perfect Tea Party candidate. He's a lieutenant - sorry - retired lieutenant colonel. He left the armed services after firing a weapon close to the head of an Iraqi prisoner and getting disciplined for it. ""He ran for Congress in 2008. He talked like this and he lost. But he's running again, and he's raised more money than his opponent -- Congressman Ron Klein. And I talked to him at CPAC. He got on the CPAC bill and he said, yes, Social Security's a Ponzi scheme, it's the biggest Ponzi scheme, but I'm not going to get rid of it right away but I, you know, hint-hint, eventually this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it."" We tracked down Weigel and asked him about his comments about West on NPR. Weigel quit his job blogging for the Washington Post this summer after e-mails he wrote critical of conservatives surfaced. He now works for Slate, an online magazine owned by The Washington Post Company. Weigel said he had spoken to West on various occasions in the past -- including at CPAC but also over the telephone. Weigel said he wasn't positive when and where he interviewed West about Social Security and said he doesn't believe he ever wrote an article or blog about West's comments on Social Security. When Weigel spotted the ad, he said he called the Klein campaign to ask for their source of evidence. The answer: the transcript of his interview on NPR. ""I'm really confused as to why the campaign would do this,"" Weigel said. ""I think it's an interesting thing to pull to start looking for something. It's weird to quote a reporter's take on a conversation he had and portray it as a quote from the candidate."" Weigel said his full statement about West wasn't a direct quote. ""I remember 'Ponzi scheme' because that is not a word everyone uses,'' he said. ""It's a word a lot of Republicans use. I was explaining what the conversation (with West) was about. I wasn't saying 'here was a direct quote about that guy.' To grab those two things and say those are quotes from him is kind of odd."" Weigel said when he spoke to Silverman at Klein's campaign, she asked him if he stood by his reporting. He says he does. ""The only thing I can say is I phrased it that way and everyone was fine with it in February 2010. It definitely is what Allen was thinking,'' Weigel said. However, ""that's a weird thing for a campaign to do -- use a reporter paraphrasing something."" Weigel said since the ad surfaced he looked through some old notes but couldn't find the Social Security conversation with West. We found at least a few articles or blogs Weigel wrote that focused on or mentioned West. Weigel wrote an Aug. 24 profile of the West-Klein race for Slate that didn't mention Social Security with the subheadline: ""Florida's Allen West may be crazy, but so far this year, that hasn't hurt Republicans."" On his campaign blog, West criticized Weigel who ""had the delusional gall to declare me, well, crazy."" Weigel also wrote a short piece Feb. 19 on terrorism issues discussed at CPAC for the Washington Independent that mentioned West and a June 23 Right Now Washington Post blog on black Republicans. Neither mentioned West's views on Social Security. We also did a Nexis search for West and Social Security during the past five years and found no articles -- other than a discussion about Klein's ad -- in which West was quoted or paraphrased as stating Social Security is a Ponzi scheme or should be destroyed. We told Silverman that Weigel said his comments during the NPR interview were not direct quotes but rather him recounting what West said. We asked if that was the campaign's only source of evidence and if they still stood by their ad and why. She wrote: ""The campaign stands behind this ad. It is an accurate reflection of Allen West's dangerous and extreme views on Social Security and Medicare."" We asked West's campaign manager Josh Grodin whether West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and made the comments about destroying it. ""I don't have time to go through every video,"" Grodin said in an interview Sept. 14. ""I think the onus is on the Klein campaign. .... I would have to go through dozens and dozens of videos."" At PolitFact Florida, we agree that the onus to prove a claim is on the campaign or person making it, but we also do additional research. Grodin asked us to send him Klein's documentation, so we sent him the NPR transcript. ""The Klein campaign is citing a claim by David Weigel. A guy who has lost all credibility and has no journalistic integrity whatsoever is making a claim? That's pathetic. There is nothing else to say about that."" Again we asked Grodin, did West make the statements? ""Has Allen ever called Social Security a Ponzi scheme? I don't know,"" Grodin said. ""Has he ever said we need to get on the right footing by destroying it? No. That's ridiculous."" So Grodin denies the remark about destroying Social Security, but the campaign isn't confirming or denying the Ponzi scheme comment On the issues section of West's website, he has a brief description about Social Security: ""The critical aspect of Social Security is that we must restore it to the independent trust fund account. Once the politicians moved it to the general operating account, they used it for their pork barrel spending spree. The fact that we are creating a jobless morass in America means there are less workers paying into the system. This is another reason why we need private sector growth, which in turn creates jobs, which will replenish the Social Security fund."" So how does Klein's claim stack up? The TV ad said West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and said ""this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it."" The Klein campaign relied on one source of evidence: an NPR transcript of an interview with a reporter who now says that his description of West was a paraphrase, not a quote -- though he does remember West using the phrase ""Ponzi scheme."" We don't think a reporter's description of what a candidate says can stand as the sole source for an attack ad, particularly when neither the reporter nor the Klein campaign can find anything he wrote about West's comments on Social Security. We couldn't find any proof that West said it, and we find Klein's proof insufficient. We rate this claim False.",None,Ron Klein,None,None,None,2010-09-15T18:12:04,2010-09-13,['None']
174,pomt-12098,"Says the Joker's ""Red Hood"" origin story is ""the true one.""",mostly false,/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/25/jake-tapper/joker-origin-story-draws-out-geek-cnns-jake-tapper/,"For Batman fans, the history of the Joker is no laughing matter. A report that said Warner Bros. is working on a spinoff featuring the origins of the arch-villain led to a Twitter tussle between DailyWire.com editor Ben Shapiro and CNN’s Jake Tapper. On Aug. 23, 2017, Shapiro tweeted his dismay at the news that Warner Bros. may feature a young version of the Joker, with a gritty, 1980s-style backdrop similar to potential producer Martin Scorsese’s well-known crime dramas. ""The whole point of the Joker is that he has no set origin story,"" Shapiro said, including a link about the potential film. Tapper, apparently a Caped Crusader devotee, tweeted a reply contradicting Shapiro: ""Not true, you obviously never heard of the RED HOOD."" Tapper included a page from Detective Comics No. 168, which was released in 1951. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The page shows the Joker telling Batman how he once had been a laboratory worker who attempted to steal $1 million from the Monarch Playing Card Company. He made his escape by swimming through chemical waste, which turned his skin white and his hair green. He took his name from the eponymous playing card and has been arching Batman ever since. But something sounded off to this fact-checker, who thought Shapiro had a point about the Joker’s past being mysterious. PolitiFact has written about whether there’s been a female Thor, and whether Wonder Woman’s Gal Gadot or Man of Steel’s Henry Cavill is paid more money, so we have some experience. In true geek fashion, we raised this objection with Tapper, saying that the Red Hood origin story was just the one with which people were most familiar. ""Because it's the true one,"" Tapper replied. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We’ll see about that. Red Hood or red herring? The most succinct reply to this came from Nick Valente, a publicist for DC Comics. ""You are correct, there is no definitive backstory for the Joker,"" he said. CASE CLOSED! But wait! Like most comic book plotlines, there’s always room for this story to expand and change. The Joker has been around almost as long as Batman himself, first appearing in 1940s Batman No. 1, when the Dark Knight got his own title after starting in Detective Comics a year earlier. There have been several iterations of the character, but through the decades he has been portrayed largely as a psychotic killer, bent on antagonizing Batman and the people of Gotham City. The Joker had no backstory to speak of until 1951, when the anecdote about the Red Hood that Tapper cited was printed. Versions of this origin have appeared in various forms over the years, with details changed. Glen Weldon, author of The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture‎, said that DC gave the character an origin story, but that was ""back in the halcyon days before a ravenous fanbase insisted that every random story must calcify into canonical truth."" One of the most famous modern versions of the Red Hood story is Alan Moore’s account in 1988’s The Killing Joke, in which the Joker is a former engineer and failed comedian who leads armed robbers into his former employer, Ace Chemical Processing, Inc., after the death of his pregnant wife. He wears the Red Hood as a disguise and jumps into the chemicals to flee Batman. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com But that doesn’t mean we should believe the Joker, because, well, he’s the Joker. He’s an unreliable narrator, because his insanity keeps him from telling the truth, and us from knowing the difference. Even Moore’s version of the Joker acknowledged that his story is essentially unknowable. ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another,"" the Joker said. ""If I’m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"" There are plenty of other variations of the story. Sometimes Batman knocks the Joker into the vat, sometimes the hapless criminal jumps. Sometimes the Red Hood isn’t involved at all. Later storylines show that the Red Hood is an alias adopted by many other criminals. Eventually, even Batman’s sidekick Robin dons the Red Hood. ""Since that (1951) story was first published, just about every time any comic's made even the most casual reference to Joker's origin, the Red Hood bit has come and gone, but the ‘fall into a vat of acid, goes nuts’ thing remains,"" Weldon said. The movies complicate things further. In the 1989 film version of Batman, Jack Nicholson’s Joker is a lifelong criminal named Jack Napier (the only time the Joker is given a first and last name) who actually is the man who killed Bruce Wayne’s parents. The late Heath Ledger’s acclaimed 2008 take on the Joker in The Dark Knight gives a nod to the ambiguity of it all, with the grease-painted antagonist telling different characters more than one version of how he was disfigured. (There’s also an offshoot movie based on Jared Leto’s tattooed Joker and Harley Quinn from 2016’s Suicide Squad coming, but that’s a different set of issues altogether.) DC Comics recognizes that their most famous villain juggles the truth. Their Origin of the Joker showed the killer acknowledging that even he gets confused by which story is right. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com ""Though the Red Hood story — in its blurriest form of spills and chemical burns — is perhaps the most-pointed to origin story for the Joker, it is by no means the definitive one,"" said Brad Ricca, SAGES Fellow at Case Western Reserve University and a comics historian. Recent comic book storylines have suggested that Batman has actually matched wits with three different Jokers through the years. Other stories hint further that the Joker may be immortal. The character has cycled through several personalities and backstories, sometimes insane and sometimes not, but always a dark-humored and lethal opponent for Batman. That’s the strength of comic books, which are free to retroactively change the continuity however the creators see fit, our experts said. Will Brooker, a film and cultural studies professor at Kingston University, said that the most sinister aspect of the character is that inability to define how he became the way he is. ""My feeling is that to pin Joker down to a fixed backstory and identity is reductive, unimaginative and suggests a lack of understanding of what Joker is really about,"" said Brooker, author of Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon. ""He is essentially the opposite of Batman, who has a fixed, definite origin. The whole point is that Batman can never work out who Joker is and where he came from."" Our ruling Tapper said the Joker's ""Red Hood"" origin story is ""the true one."" That's right, we're fact-checking where the Joker came from. So sue us! This claim is throwing down the gauntlet for comic book nerds, pointing to a 1951 backstory about the Joker wearing a disguise and swimming through chemical waste as the one, true origin of the archvillain. He may prefer that version, and that’s fine, because it’s not wrong. But comic historians and even a DC Comics publicist we consulted agreed that the Joker has no definitive backstory — indeed, that is one of the defining strengths of the character. We rate Tapper’s statement Mostly False. See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com",None,Jake Tapper,None,None,None,2017-08-25T10:00:00,2017-08-23,"['Red_Hood', 'Joker_(comics)']"
175,pomt-11460,"""China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/08/angus-king/does-much-steel-does-us-import-china/,"President Donald Trump said his administration would slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States, the latest in a series of moves to reorder the country’s trade arrangements along lines Trump believes are more favorable to American interests. The Trump administration has long criticized China for flooding the U.S. market with cheap commodities, and the 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum Trump announced March 1 seemed calculated in part to rein in what the administration considers unfair Chinese trade practices. But some critics, like Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, have charged that a steel tariff would do more harm to U.S. allies like Canada, and American small businesses, than it would do to China. Following Trump’s announcement, King said he heard complaints from constituents who run steel-reliant small businesses. King said one business owner reported an 8 percent increase in steel costs, and another worried about cost increases on steel imported from a nearby Canadian partner. While Trump may have a point about unfair trade practices, King said, Beijing would hardly bear the brunt of an import tax on steel, given its relatively small U.S. market share. ""China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S,"" King said during a March 4 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. So how much does China account for U.S. steel imports? We decided to mine for answers. Transshipment of Chinese steel Measuring U.S. steel imports by country is not as straightforward as it might seem. The American steel industry has argued that China has a backdoor to U.S. markets through a practice known as transshipment, whereby countries buy Chinese steel and modify it before exporting to the United States. Trump drew attention to this practice during March 6 remarks at the White House. ""If you talk China, I’ve watched where the reporters have been writing 2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that’s not right. They transship all through other countries,"" Trump said. ""It doesn’t look good when it all comes out of China, so they send it through other countries, and it comes to us. And it’s putting our steel mills out of business."" Experts we spoke to said there’s no hard data on transshipment, which makes the scale of this practice difficult to gauge. Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted the Commerce Department was unable to quantify the problem in a recent investigation — known as a Section 232 report — that probed the effect of steel and aluminum imports on U.S. national security. The report said only that an ""unknown portion"" of Chinese steel is further processed in third-party countries before entering the United States. ""It’s at least fair to say that the president is making a strong claim without solid evidence to back that claim up,"" he said. Alden added that the biggest targets of Trump's steel tariff would be the European Union, Japan, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Korea. (The White House is reportedly considering granting an exemption Canada and Mexico.) ""Except for Korea,"" he said, ""none of the others seems to be a transshipment concern."" Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the amount of Chinese steel that enters the United States through transshipment is not enough to call into question the reliability of the Commerce Department’s import data. He also pushed back on how Trump characterized transshipment. ""China sells raw and semi-finished steel to other countries, which then make more highly valued products. (But Trump's use of) the word 'transshipment' implied that the same piece of metal arrives, for example, in Veracruz and then is shipped to Houston with no transformation,"" Hufbauer said. ""This is Trump’s imagination."" So let’s set the issue of transshipment to one side and focus on the steel products the Trump administration has eyed for tariffs. According to Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the only steel imports subject to Trump's proposed tariffs are those which have been identified by the Commerce Department. The department measures U.S. steel imports in two ways: quantity and U.S. dollar value. Under each yardstick, China’s share is relatively small. China's share of U.S. steel imports In terms of quantity, China accounts for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports, according to 2017 data. That’s far behind traditional U.S. allies like Canada (roughly 18 percent), the European Union (about 21 percent) and South Korea (nearly 10 percent). Expressed another way, the United States imported 740,126 tons of steel from China last year, compared to nearly 5.7 million tons from Canada and just over 5 million tons from European Union countries. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com China’s share is slightly larger in terms of dollar value, but still relatively small. The United States imported just shy of $1 billion in Chinese steel in 2017, or 3.35 percent of the United States’ nearly $30 billion annual steel import market, according to Commerce Department data. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com An aide to King pointed us to an interview with Bown, of the Peterson Institute, from September 2017, in which Bown said 4 percent of U.S. imports of steel come from China. But its proportion of U.S. steel imports, relative to other countries, has shrunk since then. In any case, he wasn’t too far off China’s 3.35 percent market share in 2017, in terms of dollar value. Experts largely backed up his broader point about the limited impact of steel tariffs on China. ""The numbers show that the tariffs will hurt trading partners — which are allies — much more than China,"" said Mac Destler, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland. Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg in Beijing, wrote that China’s total exports of steel and aluminum are equal to about 0.5 percent of GDP, with most of that from steel. ""Relative to fears from Trump’s campaign trail rhetoric, in which he threatened an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on all imports from China, these measures are extremely limited,"" Orlik wrote of Trump’s proposed tariffs. Our ruling King said, ""China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S."" There are different ways to measure U.S. steel imports by country. In terms of dollar value, Chinese steel made up 3.35 percent of the United States’ nearly $30 billion annual steel import market in 2017. But in terms of quantity, China accounted for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports that year. King’s claim tracks closely to one of two measures. But in either case, King does not stray too far from the Commerce Department’s 2017 data. We rate this Mostly True.

176,pomt-14784,"The ""federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls.""",false,/texas/statements/2015/dec/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrectly-says-obama-forcing-boys-and-g/,"Sen. Ted Cruz recently veered from discussing Syria to suggesting our government wants schoolboys to shower with girls. The Republican presidential candidate commented after interviewer Steven Crowder mentioned ""genetically proper pronouns."" ""Look,"" Cruz said, ""these guys are so nutty that the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."" The Texan went on: ""Now listen: I’m the father of two daughters, and the idea that the federal government is coming in saying that boys, with all the god-given equipment of boys, can be in the shower room with junior high girls – this is lunacy. And I bet you there are a whole lot of parents – particularly parents of daughters – that are not eager to have the federal government saying, ‘Guess what? Your daughter has to shower with a boy, if he wants to be in there,’ "" Cruz said. A video of the conversation was posted online Nov. 19, 2015. We hadn’t heard about a push for coed showers by the government under President Barack Obama and also didn’t hear back from Cruz’s campaign about how he concluded the government is trying to let boys shower with girls. But a Nov. 22, 2015, news story in The Advocate said Cruz ""appeared to be alluding to the administration’s recent support of two separate transgender students who have sued their school districts after administrators refused to let the students use the restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity."" Our read: Just one of the mentioned situations involves a student seeking access to locker rooms, though news stories indicate there have been other recent instances of transgender individuals seeking unfettered access to high school locker rooms. What’s a transgender person? For starters, it’s not factually accurate to say that letting transgender students into locker rooms amounts to boys being permitted to shower with girls. A transgender individual is a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. Broadly, this can mean a person born a boy identifies as a girl or vice versa. A transgender also may receive hormone treatments and undertake sex reassignment surgery. Pat Griffin, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, advocates for including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students in college and interscholastic athletics. Griffin wrote in September 2015: ""It is important for policy-makers to understand that transgender girls (who were assigned a male gender at birth) are not boys. Their consistent and affirmed gender identity as girls is as deep-seated as the gender identity of non-transgender girls."" After we posted this fact check, readers suggested we'd failed to capture the ongoing debate over transgender rights; we followed up by writing this story. ""Student A"" in Illinois The Advocate story led us to check into the case of an Illinois transgender girl barred by her school district from changing clothes for gym class and other activities with girls. The girl, represented by the ACLU of Illinois, filed a complaint in 2013 charging sex discrimination in violation of federal law. On Nov. 2, 2015, the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education wrote the superintendent of the school district in Palatine, Ill., northwest of Chicago, saying the district’s restriction violates Title IX, the federal bar on sex discrimination in any education program or activity. The ACLU of Illinois declared the federal holding had national significance. ""The decision places school districts all across the nation on notice that Title IX requires making such facilities available for students who are transgender,"" the group said. ""It is the first such decision issued by the department, building on legal briefs and policy statements of the federal government interpreting federal laws prohibiting discrimination."" The office’s letter, signed by regional director Adele Rapport of Chicago, says ""Student A"" was born male and from a young age identified as female, transitioning in middle school ""to living full-time as a young woman"" and, among steps evidently not including sex reassignment surgery, taking ""an ongoing course of hormone therapy."" Also, the letter says, the district has given the student ""unlimited access to all girls’ restrooms in the school"" and ""allows her to participate in girls’ athletics."" According to the letter, the student, required to take a daily gym class, sought ""an opportunity to change clothes privately within the girls’ locker rooms, in an area such as a restroom stall."" The district answered that it would not be ""practicable"" to do so in the school’s six girls locker rooms ""because there were too few stalls and too many students,"" the office wrote. The letter further says the student told the office in October 2015 she’d use privacy curtains in the locker rooms if the school made them available. Talks involving the district and office did not lead to a resolution, the letter says. School district stresses private changing rooms The Palatine-based Township High School District 211 said in a Nov. 2, 2015, press release it disagreed with the department’s ruling and beyond continuing settlement negotiations, it was prepared to ""engage in all avenues of due process to determine whether our position of honoring the rights of all the students is within the law."" The district’s release also said: ""The students in our schools are teenagers, not adults, and one's gender is not the same as one's anatomy. Boys and girls are in separate locker rooms – where there are open changing areas and open shower facilities – for a reason."" A Nov. 3, 2015, Chicago Tribune news story said the district had 30 days to reach an agreement with authorities or risk having its federal educational funding suspended or terminated and the matter also could be referred to the Department of Justice. And on Dec. 3, 2015, after Cruz made his claim, the government announced a settlement with the district agreeing to give the student access to school locker rooms ""based on the student's request to change in private changing stations"" in the rooms. Other conflicts A Nov. 2, 2015, New York Times news story on the Illinois dispute said: ""The rights of transgender students have become the focus of disputes in school districts in many states, leading to divergent approaches regarding which sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and pronouns they are addressed by. In separate cases, two California school districts agreed to lift restrictions on transgender locker room and restroom access after federal officials intervened. Students at one Missouri high school protested a decision by the district to let a transgender girl use female locker rooms and restrooms."" In the Missouri instance, the Times reported Sept. 2, 2015, transgender Lila Perry, 17, used girls’ restrooms and locker rooms until a local protest led her to drop her physical education class. Professor’s take We called Griffin, the professor emeritus, who told us it’s her view that boys showering with girls is an inaccurate characterization of the government saying transgender students should, by law, have full access to school facilities including locker rooms. Griffin also called the education department’s ruling in Illinois ""the developing precedent"" nationally. Cruz’s statement, Griffin said, amounts to ""fearmongering"" and ""reflects a complete ignorance"" of transgender students, especially overlooking the fact that a transgender girl is not a boy so ""it’s not a boy in the girls’ locker room."" In contrast, Griffin said, the focus of most U.S. school officials has been on ensuring every student has a right to privacy in a locker room or restroom. Griffin, asked about state policies on transgender student-athletes, pointed us to a breakdown on Transathlete.com, which compiles policies and research regarding transgender inclusion in sports. According to the website, Texas ranks among about a dozen states with no policy ensuring transgender participation. The site touts Massachusetts’ policy, which says, in part: ""Where there are sex-segregated classes or athletic activities, including intramural and interscholastic athletics, all students must be allowed to participate in a manner consistent with their gender identity."" We also reached out to the federal education department, which did not comment on Cruz’s claim but pointed us to a Nov. 2, 2015, statement by Catherine Lhamon, an assistant secretary in the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, saying: ""All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities – this is a basic civil right. Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls’ locker room. The district can provide access to this student while also respecting all students’ privacy."" Our ruling Cruz said the ""federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."" Cruz’s vision of schoolboys everywhere showering with girls grossly distorts the issue. The fact is the Obama administration has sided with transgender students seeking access to school facilities including locker rooms, holding that anything less would violate federal anti-discrimination requirements. Such conflicts — few and far between — haven’t had to do with the government wanting boys to shower with girls. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

177,pomt-02525,"Mark Warner voted for ""nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt.""",true,/virginia/statements/2014/feb/10/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-warner-voted-new-taxes-and-more-deb/,"Republican Ed Gillespie kicked off his campaign for the U.S. Senate by denouncing Democratic incumbent Mark Warner as a spendthrift. ""Sen. Warner promised us fiscal responsibility, but he’s voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt."" Gillespie said in a video last month. We wondered whether Gillespie was right. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said his boss’s claim stems from Warner’s support of a Democratic budget plan that squeaked through the Senate last March on a 50-49 vote. The plan -- authored by by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash. -- called for $975 billion in new revenues over 10 years to be matched by an equal amount of budget cuts. The new revenues would come from targeting tax breaks used by high earners and corporations. That accounts for the ""nearly $1 trillion in new taxes,"" that Gillespie cited. What about the $7 trillion in new debt? Logan said that also came from Murray’s bill. The legislation contained estimates that it would expand total debt from $17.1 trillion in fiscal 2013 to $24.4 trillion in fiscal 2023. That comes to a $7.3 trillion increase. Total U.S debt is the sum of two major calculations: 1) The amount of ""intergovernmental holdings"", or money the government owes itself to support beneficiary programs such as Social Security; and 2) The amount of ""public debt"" in Treasury securities that are held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve and state, local and foreign governments. Economists generally prefer to discuss the national debt in terms of the amount that is publicly held. Murray’s bill would have lifted that portion from $12.2 trillion in 2013 tor $18.2 trillion in 2023 -- a $6 trillion increase. Now, let’s turn to Warner, who’s made budget reform his signature issue since entering the Senate in 2009. He’s tried to establish a bipartisan coalition of senators who share his views that the nation’s financial problems can be solved only through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. He’s criticized Republicans who refuse to increase taxes and Democrats who refuse to rein in entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Warner cast four major votes on budget plans last year: On March 21, he opposed a bill passed by House Republicans that would have balanced the budget in 10 years through trillions of dollars in cuts and no new taxes. The bill, which would have increased the national debt by $3 trillion at the end of the 10 years, was defeated in the Senate on a mostly partisan vote. On March 23, he supported Murray’s plan, which was rejected by the House. On Sept. 27, he supported a temporary government funding bill that passed the Senate. The House, however, insisted that the stopgap measure delay implementation of Obamacare. The resulting impasse led to a 16-day government shutdown. On Dec 18, he voted for a successful compromise budget that did not essentially alter spending, revenues or the rising arc of the national debt, projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to reach a total $25.2 trillion in 2023. The public debt is projected to be $19.1 trillion in 2023. Our ruling Gillespie says Warner ""voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt."" Although some economists might quibble with his debt figure, we don’t. We rate his statement True.",None,Ed Gillespie,None,None,None,2014-02-10T00:00:00,2014-01-16,['None']
178,pomt-05753,"Says Rick Santorum ""funded Planned Parenthood.""",half-true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/01/ron-paul/ron-paul-ad-claims-rick-santorum-voted-fund-planne/,"Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum says he’s the only consistent conservative in the Republican presidential field, but a new Ron Paul campaign ad says the label is phony. Paul’s ad calls Santorum a ""counterfeit conservative"" who, among other sins, ""funded Planned Parenthood."" We decided to check whether Santorum, well known for his opposition to abortion and even contraception in some instances, supported government funding of the controversial women’s health provider. A look at the funding When we contacted Paul’s campaign for backup, his spokesman provided us a list of votes that Santorum -- and Paul -- made on large appropriations bills for the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal departments. The bills including funding for something called Title X. According to the Health and Human Services website, Title X provides ""comprehensive family planning services."" With an emphasis on serving low-income Americans, the services are defined as ""contraceptive services and related counseling"" as well as ""preventive health services such as: patient education and counseling; breast and pelvic examinations; breast and cervical cancer screening according to nationally recognized standards of care; sexually transmitted disease (STD) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention education, counseling, testing and referral; and pregnancy diagnosis and counseling. By law, Title X funds may not be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning."" Despite the ban on using federal funds for abortions, critics (including Paul) say the funds are ""fungible,"" meaning even though government dollars don’t pay for abortions directly, the funding frees other money that can be used for abortions. The bulk of Planned Parenthood’s work involves routine women’s health care -- pelvic exams, STD testing and counseling and contraceptives. It is also the country’s biggest abortion provider and a significant recipient of Title X funds. Santorum’s votes The list Paul’s campaign sent us shows votes on appropriations bills from 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. In each case, Santorum voted for the bills, and Paul voted against. Looking closely at the bill from 2006, Santorum’s last HHS appropriations vote in the Senate, the $142.5 billion spending package allocated money for everything from the human genome project to aging services, from the black lung disability trust fund to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. As for Title X: ""$285,963,000 shall be for the program under title X of the Public Health Service Act to provide for voluntary family planning projects."" Santorum’s response We didn’t hear back from Santorum’s campaign for this story. But he has spoken on the topic in interviews and debates, explaining that while he personally opposes the use of contraceptives, he supports their availability as a matter of public policy. Talking to CBS on Feb. 17, 2012, Santorum said, ""It’s funny that I’ve been criticized by Governor Romney and by Ron Paul for actually having voted for something called Title X, which is actually federal funding of contraception. … My public policy beliefs are that this contraception should be available. Again, I’ve supported Title X funding. I’ve also supported abstinence-based education because I believe that is a healthier alternative."" During a debate in Arizona on Feb. 22, 2012, Santorum struggled to explain his position of having voted for the funding while declaring opposition to it: ""As Congressman Paul knows, I opposed Title X funding. I've always opposed Title X funding, but it's included in a large appropriation bill that includes a whole host of other things, including the funding for the National Institutes of Health, the funding for Health and Human Services and a whole bunch of other departments. It's a multi-billion-dollar bill. ""What I did, because Title X was always pushed through, I did something that no one else did. Congressman Paul didn't. I said, well, if you're going to have Title X funding, then we're going to create something called Title XX, which is going to provide funding for abstinence-based programs, so at least we'll have an opportunity to provide programs that actually work in -- in keeping children from being sexually active instead of facilitating children from being sexually active. And I pushed Title XX … to accomplish that goal. … As president of the United States, I will defund Planned Parenthood; I will not sign any appropriation bill that funds Planned Parenthood."" Our ruling Paul’s ad says Santorum funded Planned Parenthood. His campaign points to Santorum’s yea votes in the Senate on massive appropriations bills for funding the federal government. Title X funding, which funnels family planning dollars to health care providers including Planned Parenthood, was in those spending measures. Santorum has been unclear about where he stands on Title X, saying in one instance that he supports Title X and in another that he opposes it. In any event, he did not vote separately for Title X but for omnibus multi-billion dollar appropriations measures that funded many other activities. Saying, as the ad does, that he ""funded Planned Parenthood,"" makes it sound like he played a larger role than being one of many votes in favor of a broad-based appropriations bill. In 2006, for instance, he was joined by all but two of his Senate Republican colleagues in voting for the bill. Paul's statement is partially accurate but it leaves out that important context.

179,pomt-11343,"""Today, we (in Pennsylvania) have higher unemployment and lower job growth than most.""",mostly true,/pennsylvania/statements/2018/apr/09/paul-mango/paul-mangos-dire-economic-portrait-pennsylvania-mo/,"In his primary bid for Pennsylvania governor, Pittsburgh-area businessman and Republican candidate Paul Mango says the Commonwealth’s economy is stalled and lagging behind those in most states across the country. ""Today, we have higher unemployment and lower job growth than most,"" Mango says in a three-minute-long online campaign video that was released in May 2017. Mango is one of three Republicans running in next month’s primary. Incumbent Gov. Tom Wolf will be on the November ballot. While it’s accurate that Pennsylvania’s economy has not rebounded as quickly as some following the Great Recession, is it true that its unemployment is higher and job growth ""lower than most""? Unemployment Mango’s campaign video was released in May 2017, the same month he formally declared his candidacy for governor. At the time the ad was released, Pennsylvania’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.8 percent and higher than the rates in roughly 40 other states, according to data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The national unemployment rate in May of 2017 was 4.3 percent. The same holds true today. Per Bureau of Labor Statistics data for Feb. 2018, Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate remained at 4.8 percent and higher than the unemployment rates of roughly 44 other states. The national rate was 4.1 percent last month. Job growth That brings us to the subject of job growth in Pennsylvania. It’s true that the Commonwealth’s economy did not rebound as quickly as some others following the Great Recession. But Antony Davies, an associate economics professor in Duquesne University’s Palumbo Donahue School of Business, said it’s also worth noting that Pennsylvania didn’t suffer as badly as many states during the recession, and therefore didn’t have as far to go in climbing out. ""In 2009, unemployment nationwide was around 10 percent,"" Davies said by phone. ""In Pennsylvania at that same time, it was around 8.4 or 8.5. We haven't improved as much as the rest of the country, but we didn’t start off as bad either."" In his ad, Mango cites a 2016Philly.comarticle for his claim that Pennsylvania’s job growth remains unusually sluggish. That article says Pennsylvania job growth ""has not been sufficient to keep up with the growth in the labor force."" Matt Beynon, a spokesman for Mango’s campaign, said the campaign relied on news reports but also substantiated the claim with source data put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ""Using either total employment or non-farm employment, Pennsylvania is in the bottom half of all the states when it comes to job growth during the Wolf administration from Jan 2015-February 2018,"" Beynon said by email. ""Additionally, it is also true that total employment in Pennsylvania has dropped each month now over the last ten months, as Pennsylvania’s economy continues to fall further behind other states."" Frank Gamrat, a senior research associate with the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, a Pittsburgh-based conservative think tank, said Pennsylvania actually hasn't had a decrease to its private jobs count since May of 2010 but showed slower private employment gains than the nation did as a whole between 2016 and 2017. (Again, Mango’s ad was released in May of 2017.) And jobs continue to be added here. In February, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) monthly payroll survey reported 10,400 jobs were added in Pennsylvania and ranks that ahead of 37 other states and the District of Columbia. These same figures were cited in a release from the office of U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico and ranking member of the Senate’s Joint Economic Committee, which said Pennsylvania added 82,800 public and private sector jobs since February of last year, more than 43 other states in that time. Additionally, the Economic Policy Institute in March reported that the number of jobs added in Pennsylvania in the last 12 months is on par with the growth seen in most other states. Our ruling Mango is right that Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate remains higher than the rates of most other states, according to federal data. It’s also true that Pennsylvania job growth has generally lagged behind the national rate — although that appears to be correcting some. But his claim that Pennsylvania has lower job growth ""than most"" gives the impression that most states are seeing stronger job creation. The national rate and individual state rates are not the same thing. The national rate is skewed by states like California with larger populations and larger workforces than most, Davies said. It’s also important to note that some states with greater post-recession job growth suffered greater recession-era job losses than Pennsylvania, as Davies also pointed out.

180,pomt-04303,"Says he ""opposed $716 billion cut to Medicare.""",half-true,/florida/statements/2012/oct/30/cw-bill-young/bill-young-says-he-opposed-716-billion-medicare-cu/,"U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, the Indian Shores Republican incumbent of 42 years, touts his credibility with seniors in a TV spot clearly aimed at the 65-plus crowd. An ensemble of older men and women, and even former Gov. Jeb Bush, praise Young for being there for seniors. ""Florida seniors couldn’t have a bigger champion than Congressman Bill Young,"" Bush says. Amid the endorsements are claims about Young’s record on Social Security, the Medicare prescription drug program, support for a balanced budget amendment, and, of course, Medicare. ""Young opposed $716-billion cut to Medicare,"" bold text shows. Below that text is a citation: ""House Roll Call Vote 165 - 3/21/2010."" It’s the House vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which Young voted against. Does that mean he rejected ""the $716 billion cut to Medicare?"" We also checked a dueling Medicare claim from his challenger, Democratic lawyer Jessica Ehrlich, over whether he voted for the Ryan budgets that ""end the current Medicare system."" The $716 billion cut You could say we’ve heard this line a time or two. This attack line is a viral one in the political world, used by Mitt Romney against President Barack Obama, Rep. Connie Mack against Sen. Bill Nelson, and in many, many, many other races across the country. It’s not a ""cut"" in the traditional sense. Medicare is an open-ended entitlement program with a growth problem that threatens its future viability. Both parties agree changes should be made. Obama did not propose a cut to Medicare’s budget in his health care law. Rather, the law made several changes to slow the growth of Medicare costs. These changes primarily affected insurance companies and hospitals -- not beneficiaries. The government, for example, will pay hospitals less if they have too many readmissions or fail to meet new benchmarks for care. The law also deals with Medicare Advantage, which is a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers started under President George W. Bush with the goal of reducing costs through marketplace competition. The plans have actually proven more expensive than traditional Medicare in recent years, so the health care law aims to reduce payments to private insurers as a way to rein in costs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. It’s worth pointing out Young could not have known he was specifically voting against $716 billion in Medicare ""cuts,"" as that had not been tabulated in time for the health care vote that happened two years earlier. Still, it was known at the bill’s passage that there were major reductions in store for Medicare service providers, said economist Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at the international health foundation Project HOPE and Medicare director under President George H.W. Bush. A tricky point for Young’s claim is that he also voted for the budget blueprint of Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- twice, actually. The budget is a congressional resolution that does not carry the force of law, and Ryan’s ideas have not been turned into detailed legislation. Even so, Ryan has said his most recent budget factors in the same $716 billion in reductions in Medicare spending. Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter made this point on Face the Nation in August, saying Ryan ""protected those cuts in his budget."" PolitiFact rated her statement True. The Romney campaign responded to Cutter’s remark with a statement that Romney intended to repeal the health care law and end the Medicare ""raid."" Ryan said he factored the $716 billion savings in his budget it ""was already in the baseline,"" the Wall Street Journal reported. ""We would never have done it in the first place."" However, his budget assumed reversal of other Obama spending decisions, the Journal pointed out. A month later, former President Bill Clinton reprised the attack in his Democratic National Convention speech, quipping, ""it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did."" We rated it True. Ehrlich’s position Ehrlich is in an interesting spot here. She, too, opposes this ""cut."" Even though she supports the health care law, she told the Tampa Bay Times, ""I am against the $500 billion cuts to Medicare in both the Affordable Care Act and the Ryan budget. I also oppose the Independent Panel Advisory Board in the Affordable Care Act and would support legislation to overturn that provision."" She has attacked Young for voting for the Ryan budgets that reshape how Medicare works. When we asked her to elaborate on her position in an interview, she said she wanted to keep Medicare ""fully funded."" ""I think we have to maintain the integrity of the program, make sure that it’s fully funded, and not advocate for cutting until we look at the budget as a whole,"" she said. She did not provide specifics for reducing the program’s spending. Young said she could not have had it both ways if she were a member of Congress at the time of the vote. ""If you voted for the bill, you voted for the Medicare cut,"" he said. Our ruling Young’s ad says he voted against the controversial $716 billion Medicare cut. What he voted against was the Affordable Care Act, which implements an estimated $716 billion reduction in payments to hospitals and private insurers in effort to reduce the program’s ever-increasing costs. He could not have known the amount would be $716 billion, as that estimate came two years after the health care vote. Meanwhile, the Republicans have their own plan for reducing future Medicare spending, by bring more private insurance companies into Medicare and offering voucher-like premium support.

181,pomt-00583,"If Fox News' presidential debate rules had been in place during the 1992 election, ""Bill Clinton wouldn't have been on the stage.""",mostly false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/07/rick-santorum/foxs-debate-rules-would-have-kept-bill-clinton-sta/,"Republicans have a bumper crop of presidential candidates, and it has created a traffic problem for the television networks that help put on the debates. At last count, there are 10 confirmed contenders (Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz) with more possible on the way (Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal). Fox News announced it would hold the first debate on Aug. 6 in Cleveland, but the cable network said it would invite only the top 10 declared candidates. The network’s ranking would be set according to ""an average of the five most recent national polls"" as of Aug. 4. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, called the cut-off arbitrary. Appearing on Fox News, where he once was a contributor, Santorum dipped into history to show that early poll results are meaningless. ""We should have the opportunity for everyone to be heard,"" he told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on June 7, 2015. ""You know, if you would have taken the top two-thirds of the folks in 1992, Bill Clinton wouldn't have been on the stage."" Clinton obviously went on to win the White House, and Santorum’s concern is obvious. While Santorum won 11 primaries in 2012, today he ranks tied for 11th in the latest Fox News poll. That’s just outside Fox News’ debate cut-off -- though that can change depending on who officially declares and what later polls show. We decided to dig into the wayback machine of primary polls. We wanted to know what numbers Santorum had in mind and reached out to his communication staff but did not hear back. What we found suggests Santorum is right that Clinton started out in 1991, the year before the presidential election, with low polling numbers. But Santorum is making a comparison that doesn’t quite fit because of the huge difference in the 1992 primaries versus the one beginning now. Moreover, by the time the Democratic candidates did debate in 1991, Clinton was not doing as poorly in the polls as Santorum claims. The early polls FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver accumulated and analyzed several cycles of presidential primary polls, including the cycle leading up to the 1992 election. Silver was able to find just three polls from January-June 1991, a period comparable to today. And the ones he found showed Clinton at the back of a crowded field -- with an average of just 1.7 percent. That was good enough for 13th out of 19 prospective candidates. In a hypothetical sense, a debate that included the top two-thirds of those candidates just barely might have excluded Clinton. The problem with such a hypothetical is that there were hardly any declared Democrats running for president by June 1991. One of the conditions for the Fox News debate is that only official, announced and registered candidates need apply. In mid 1991, the would-be frontrunner was New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Cuomo ended up not running. And in fact, the top 9 candidates in early polls that year all declined to run, Silver found. Clinton himself didn’t announce his candidacy until October 1991. So a snapshot of June 1991 versus June 2015 is hardly useful. Neither is a comparison that focuses on an August 2015 debate. The earliest debates in the 1992 cycle we found were an NBC debate on Dec. 15, 1991, and one sponsored by PBS on Jan. 19, 1992. By then, the hypothetical field had been narrowed to actual candidates, and the polling was more favorable to Clinton. By the time of the first debates, there were five main Democratic candidates: Clinton, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Sens. Tom Harkin, Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas. A sixth candidate, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, withdrew on Jan. 8, 1992. He participated in the Dec. 15 debate but not the one on Jan. 19. A search on LexisNexis provided us with a handful of polls for the men who were left standing: Poll Date Brown Clinton Harkin Kerrey Tsongas New York Times/CBS Oct. 22 12 5 3 7 2 Los Angeles Times Nov. 12 18 9 6 5 4 Los Angeles Times Nov. 27 20 9 4 5 4 USA Today/CNN/Gallup Jan. 14 21 17 9 11 6 Silver’s polling average from July to December 1991 shows a tight pack: Candidate Polling average Mario Cuomo 9.9 Douglas Wilder 9.7 Jerry Brown 14.9 Bill Clinton 8.3 Bob Kerrey 7.7 Tom Harkin 6.3 Paul Tsongas 4.1 The point here is that there never were more than 10 serious declared candidates, as might happen in 2015. And Clinton’s position was not as poor as Santorum made it seem. By the time of the first debate, Clinton would have passed muster by the Fox News standard as an announced candidate ranked among the top two-thirds of the pack. Our ruling Santorum said that if Fox News had applied its 2016 rules to a hypothetical Democratic primary debate in 1992, that Clinton would not have been on the stage. Santorum was trying to make the point that early presidential polls may not be the most useful yardstick to determine who gets into a debate and who doesn’t. In that regard, Clinton’s story from 1991 somewhat backs that up. Early presidential polls showed Clinton as a significant underdog. But in reality, Santorum errs in trying to make a comparison between the 1992 and 2016 presidential cycles. Most of the top Democrats Clinton trailed in those early polls never actually declared as candidates. Under the Fox News rules, none of them would qualify to participate in its debate. And by the time the field was set in late 1991, Clinton’s position in the polls suggested he was a viable candidate. Santorum’s statement contains an element of truth in that Clinton did start low in the polls, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

182,pomt-01133,"The United States ""decided waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents in the Philippine revolution.""",true,/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/23/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-us-soldiers-have-been-/,"The so-called ""CIA torture report"" has heightened debate over whether certain interrogation techniques used by the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks constituted torture. Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse weighed in on Dec. 14 when he appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" with host Chris Wallace and political consultant Karl Rove. In the portion of the program that dealt with whether waterboarding, which simulates the feeling of drowning, constitutes torture, Whitehouse said there was precedent in the United States to conclude that it was. ""We decided that waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents during the Philippine revolution,"" Whitehouse said. ""We decided waterboarding was torture when we prosecuted Japanese soldiers as war criminals for waterboarding Americans during World War II, and we decided waterboarding was torture when the American court system described waterboarding as torture when Ronald Reagan and his Department of Justice prosecuted a Texas sheriff and several of his associates for waterboarding detainees."" Because the Philippine revolution, which dates back to the 1890s, is the earliest reference Whitehouse made, we decided to check out that part of his statement. While we were waiting for Whitehouse's office to respond to our request for documentation, we started poking around ourselves. There's little doubt that what is now called waterboarding -- then known as water torture or by the odd name of the ""water cure"" -- was used by Americans in the Philippines after the U.S. gained colonial authority over the islands from the Spanish in 1898 under the terms of the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War. Filipinos had been recruited to help fight the Spanish but when the Spanish were vanquished, the Filipinos tried to gain their independence. The resulting guerilla war had some things in common with the U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, complete with boobytraps, suspicions that all Filipinos were guerrilla fighters, and the depiction of the guerillas as treacherous fanatics. Most accounts we found report that an infantry captain named Edwin F. Glenn was found guilty of engaging in water torture during the war. Glenn was a judge advocate at the time he was involved in waterboarding. By the time he was court-martialed, he had been promoted to major. He was specifically charged with administering the ""water cure"" to a prominent Philippine resident named Tobeniano Ealdama, whom he suspected of collaborating with insurgents. Whitehouse's office cited a detailed 1903 Senate report on courts-martial in the Philippines. The section on Glenn accuses him of carrying out ""a method of punishment commonly known in the Philippine Islands as the 'water cure;' that is, did cause water to be introduced into the mouth and stomach of the said Ealdama against his will"" around Nov. 27, 1900. Glenn admitted to the practice but defended it, arguing -- as waterboarding supporters do today -- that it saved lives. A military court didn't think that was sufficient justification. He was found guilty. But his sentence was light -- a one-month suspension and a $50 fine, which was the equivalent to more than $1,200 today. Glenn wasn't the only soldier to be court-martialed for administering the ""water cure,"" and testimony in the Senate report makes it clear that this was frequently used to extract information. First Lt. Julien E. Gaujot, of the 10th U.S. Cavalry, was found guilty of doing it to three priests in January, 1902. He was suspended from command for three months, forfeiting $50 in pay per month for that period. The military court made it clear that, in the cases of both men, the court was being lenient. Like Glenn, Gaujot admitted using water torture, saying he did it because he knew the priests were insurgents and ""I knew that they possessed information that would be valuable to the American cause."" ""It was impossible to obtain reliable information regarding the insurgents from the inhabitants, who are, as a whole, crafty, lying, and treacherous, many of them being fanatical savages who respect no laws and whose every instinct is depraved,"" Glenn told the court. Not all of the courts-martial were successful. For example, 1st Lt. Edwin A. Hickman of the First U.S. Cavalry was brought up on charges for ordering that two Filipinos be held upside down and the upper half of their bodies dunked in an open spring to extract information and to get the men to act as guides. He admitted doing it but argued that it wasn't unlawful. The court acquitted Hickman because of ""the abnormal and disgraceful methods of armed resistance to the authority of the United States; the treachery of the natives generally; the paramount necessity of obtaining information, and the belief on the part of the accused that the punishment administered was within the rules of war and under the instructions of superior military authority."" In these cases, Judge Advocate General George B. Davis said General Order #100, which dated back to 1863, ""contains the requirement that military necessity does not admit of cruelty -- that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge -- nor of maiming or wounding except in fight, nor of torture to extort confessions."" In these cases, there was no emergency that required torture, Davis argued. One might debate whether the ""water cure"" is the same as waterboarding. In both cases, the victim is lying down and restrained. With waterboarding, the face is sometimes covered by a towel with the body tilted to try to keep water in the upper airways and out of the lungs. With the water cure, water went directly into the mouth and was forced into the stomach, causing a great deal of pain. In both instances, the goal is not to drown the victim, but to make things as unpleasant as possible. Both produce the sensation of being unable to breathe. Even if the water doesn't get into the lungs directly, the victim may vomit and inhale the vomit, which can be fatal. The water cure was clearly effective in inducing fear. According to accounts in the Senate report, just the threat of repeating ""the water cure"" could be enough to break the will of recalcitrant Filipinos. ""At a minimum, the techniques are substantially similar,"" said Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said the United States ""decided waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents in the Philippine revolution."" The ""water cure"" as performed in the Philippines is not significantly different from the waterboarding done in reaction to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Both forms of water torture -- and the risks -- are similar and the Senate report from 1903 makes it clear that military prosecutors regarded the ""water cure"" as a form of torture.

183,pomt-05566,Says Barack Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf as president.,true,/texas/statements/2012/apr/04/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-barack-obama-has-played-over-9/,"David Dewhurst, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, looks past other hopefuls from his party in an online video contrasting the state of the U.S. economy and -- fore! -- Barack Obama’s enjoyment of golf. The video from the Texas lieutenant governor shows Obama golfing or riding a golf cart along with snippets of others speaking about the nation’s economic troubles. The advertisement’s money moment, though, lies in these claims that appear in red letters next to video of Obama, in shorts, golfing: ""6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama"" and ""over 90 rounds of golf."" We’re separately analyzing Dewhurst’s charge about American poverty. But is he right that Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf, meaning as many as 1,620 holes? Many presidents have played golf, including 15 of the 18 presidents before Obama, according to a January 2009 Golf Digest article,The magazine ranked John F. Kennedy as the best previous presidential golfer, and his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, as second-best; Eisenhower, the article says, had a putting green outside the Oval Office. As Dewhurst’s backup for the Obama claim, his campaign pointed us to a January 2012 Washington Post blog post noting that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had bemoaned Obama’s ""90 rounds"" at the Jan. 23, 2012, GOP presidential debate in Tampa. According to the debate transcript, Romney said: ""We have to have a president who understands how to get an economy going again. He does not. He plays 90 rounds of golf when you have 25 million people out of work."" He later brought up the 90 rounds again at a Michigan campaign event, according to a Feb. 14, 2012, article in the Detroit News. Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch also offered as backup a Dec. 27, 2011, blog post by Tina Korbe on the Hot Air website, which describes itself as ""the leading conservative blog for breaking news and commentary covering the Republican primary, the 2012 election, politics, media, and culture."" Korbe’s post states, in part: ""Not only did Barack Obama golf on Christmas day, but he hit the links yesterday, too — and that round marked the 90th of his presidency."" Korbe’s post linked to a Dec. 26, 2011, blog post by White House correspondent Keith Koffler, whose website is WhiteHouseDossier.com. Koffler’s post said: ""After an hour of hiking, President Obama Monday got down to the serious business at hand, heading out to golf for the second day in his first three days of vacation. He was back on the course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. With this one, Obama reaches a new milestone, having gone golfing 90 times in less than three years as president."" His summary also says that this was ""the 32nd time he’s been on the links this year, a record for the president. His 32 outings eclipses the 2010 mark of 30 and is far ahead of his 2009 tally of 28 rounds as president."" By email, we asked Koffler about those figures. He replied that as of April 4, 2012, the president had taken in 93 golf outings, counting one in 2012 and 34 in 2011. We wondered how the frequency of Obama’s golf outings compared to such expeditions by other presidents. Koffler replied: ""I don't have a comparison to other presidents, though (George W.) Bush stopped in 2003."" Bush said in a May 2008 interview with Politico and Yahoo News that he decided to forgo golf after the August 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, which killed Sergio Vieira de Mello, the top U.N. official in Iraq and the organization’s high commissioner for human rights. ""I remember when de Mello, who was at the U.N., got killed in Baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good man's life,"" Bush said, according to Politico. ""I was playing golf — I think I was in Central Texas — and they pulled me off the golf course and I said, ‘It's just not worth it any more to do.’"" We didn’t immediately hear back from the White House about how often Obama has gone golfing. Separately, CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller, who tracks each president’s activities, responded to our inquiry by pointing out that he said on Twitter April 2, 2012, that Obama had just played his first round of golf of the year, spending five hours on a course the day before. Knoller told us by email that the round was Obama’s 93rd as president. We rate Dewhurst’s claim as True.",None,David Dewhurst,None,None,None,2012-04-04T18:20:55,2012-04-04,['None']

""You've had the advantage of having, other than a two-year period, Republicans in charge of at least one part of government for at least some time,"" Walker added, then noted. ""Before we came into office, for many years there was a Democratic governor, a Democratic Assembly and a Democratic Senate."" We can’t fact check Walker’s implication that Wisconsin fell behind because Democrats were running the whole show. That’s his opinion. But we can check his facts on who was in charge and when. Walker didn’t say how far back his comparison went, but his mention of Pawlenty suggests at least 2003, when Pawlenty was first elected. Here’s what we found when examining partisan control in both states: Minnesota Pawlenty served two terms, from 2003 through 2010, giving way to Dayton at the same time Walker assumed power in Madison in January 2011. So that means Republicans controlled at least one key lever for those eight years. From 2011 to present it’s been Dayton, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, in the governor’s chair in St. Paul. Republicans held both legislative chambers in 2011-12, and one starting in 2015. But Democrats -- as Walker correctly noted -- ran both chambers from 2013-14 and of course had Dayton for those years as well. Wisconsin Walker confined his argument here to the years before he took office in 2011. But he misfires in saying Democrats had a total lock on power for ""many years."" Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle took office in Wisconsin in 2003 -- at the same time Pawlenty assumed control next door. Doyle also served eight years, then decided not to run for a third term. But Doyle only had a Legislature under total Democratic control for his last two years, 2009 and 2010. In fact, Republicans controlled the Assembly and Senate for Doyle’s first four years. Control then was split for two years before Democrats enjoyed their brief unfettered reign. Going back further, to 1995, Republicans in Wisconsin controlled at least one of the three power spots every year until 2009. The kind of single-party dominance that Walker claimed Democrats have enjoyed for many years is rare in recent Wisconsin history. Walker, though, is now in year five with Republicans gripping all three levers of authority at the Capitol. Our rating Walker said Minnesota’s ""advantage"" has been having ""Republicans in charge of at least one part of government"" for all but two years, while Wisconsin Democrats ""for many years"" controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship before 2011. In making the comparison, though, he overstates how long the Democrats had total control in Wisconsin. It was for a two-year period, before he took office and Republicans won complete control. The Republicans have had that status more than twice as long as the ""many years"" Walker said Democrats did.

185,pomt-13263,"""In 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families.""",half-true,/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/14/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-says-pat-mccrory-raised-taxes-middle-cl/,"At Tuesday’s debate for the North Carolina governor’s race, Democratic challenger Roy Cooper attacked Republican Gov. Pat McCrory for pushing tax reforms that mostly helped the wealthy. Republicans gained a majority in both chambers of the General Assembly in 2011. After McCrory became governor in 2013, the state passed sweeping changes to tax law. The new GOP leaders cut personal and business income taxes and paid for it in part by expanding the sales tax base and ending some income tax deductions. ""The governor promised people a tax cut,"" Cooper said. ""He came through for the corporations and for those at the top, but everyday working people got tax increases. In 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families. And literally we’re talking about, literally, from birth to death."" We wondered if it was really true that the state’s Republican leaders, who so often tout their record on tax cuts, actually raised taxes in 67 different ways. Cooper’s campaign provided us with an itemized list of the increases it was citing from McCrory’s tenure as governor. They do include instances from birth to death — higher fees for screening newborn babies, and a new tax on tombstone installation. Many came earlier this year, in a large expansion of the sales tax base that went into effect in March bearing McCrory’s signature. It created dozens of new sales taxes applied to services and labor. Auto repair shops have long charged sales taxes on parts. Now they must also charge sales tax on their labor. There are new 43 service taxes, all listed here by the Department of Revenue. Cooper’s campaign also pointed us two dozen other instances of laws McCrory has signed since 2013 that increased taxes, created new taxes or reduced or eliminated tax breaks, incentives, deductions and exemptions. So the number is right. In fact Cooper said 67, and his campaign’s list includes 69 examples. A few of them don’t really affect middle class families, like the state’s tax credits for filmmakers that were allowed to expire, or a law that capped the sales tax refund for nonprofits at $45 million — hardly a level the local PTA has to worry about surpassing. However, nearly all of the 69 examples the campaign pointed to do directly affect middle class families. We won’t list them all, but notable examples include: --Ending the annual tax-free weekend for back-to-school shopping. --Ending deductions for contributions made to college savings accounts. --Eliminating a $4,000 deduction for government retirement income and a $2,000 deduction for private retirement income. --Taxing forgiven mortgage debt as income. ""The next time you go to a movie or you get your car repaired or you buy school supplies at a back to school weekend, you look at that receipt and the taxes are a courtesy of Governor McCrory,"" Cooper said at the debate. Cooper is right that McCrory raised taxes 60-plus ways that could affect middle class families. But that’s not the whole story. And we’ve lowered our Truth-O-Meter ratings in the past when politicians have made claims about taxes that left out important context, like this one. And our friends at the Washington Post gave Three Pinocchios to a 2014 claim that the state’s tax changes raised taxes for most North Carolinians. Does Cooper's claim face a similar fate? The GOP tax reforms Before the tax cuts, North Carolina had a three-tier system for individual income taxes, ranging from 6 to 7.75 percent. With the GOP-led changes, the income tax rate dropped to a single flat rate of 5.8 percent, and then dropped again to 5.75 percent this year. The Tax Foundation, a group that advocates for low tax rates, has frequently praised North Carolina for its income tax cuts. So has the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. In 2014 one its budget analysts wrote that ""McCrory and the legislature’s plan passed one of the most impressive tax reform packages in any state in years."" Earlier this month, McCrory was named one of just five governors with an A on the Cato Institute’s annual report, ""Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors."" The cuts, combined with a higher standard deduction – it more than doubled for married couples filing jointly, from $6,000 to $15,000 – could lead to hundreds of dollars of savings each year for a typical middle class family. The state’s median household income is around $50,000. It’s harder to estimate, however, just how much extra the typical middle class family will be paying due to the dozens of tax increases and/or lost deductions that Cooper mentioned. That’s because many of them won’t apply to most families, or aren’t very uniform in their cost. Plumbing, vehicle repairs, car washes and tire services are pretty ubiquitous, but even there the labor costs can vary wildly from business to business. And plenty of the new tax increases – like on boat repairs, shoe shining, jewelry cleaning, bullet reloading and fire extinguisher recharging – won’t apply to most people very often, if ever. There was one tax credit that was eliminated that many people used and we can count easily – the Earned Income Tax Credit. It ended in 2014. In 2011, more than 900,000 households in North Carolina claimed the EITC and got an average of $116 in savings, according to a 2013 study from the liberal Budget and Tax Center. Many families saved more than $116 when their income tax rates were cut. But when you start adding in the additional taxes on services, the other lost credits and deductions, and more? It’s possible some people might be paying more now than they were before the tax cuts – especially on the lower end of the income scale. A 2015 study from the liberal groups Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) and The Budget & Tax Center found that the bottom 20 percent of North Carolinians paid taxes equivalent to 9.2 percent of their income, while the top 1 percent paid taxes equivalent to 5.3 percent of their income. We here at PolitiFact also looked into North Carolina’s tax reforms in 2014 and ruled it Mostly True that the state’s tax changes ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy."" And that was before any of the dozens of new sales taxes were enacted. Those have shifted the tax burden away from the wealthy even more, since sales taxes are regressive in nature. Our ruling Cooper said that ""in 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families."" We find his tally of the tax increases to be correct, yet many of them will affect only small groups of people in any given year. And Cooper cherry-picks by leaving out the substantial reduction in the income tax rate, which applied broadly to people at all income levels, even though it did mostly help the wealthy.

Leggings made a fashion comeback. Democrats took back the Oregon House. And that fall, The Oregonian reported on a bunch of state legislators for accepting lavish trips to Maui courtesy of the Oregon Beer and Wine Distributors Association. One of those legislators was state Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, who faces Rep. Chuck Riley, D-Hillsboro, in the Nov. 2 general election. To no one’s surprise, Riley is bringing up Starr’s stay at the palatial Grand Wailea Hotel in May 2002 to attend the distributors’ conference. Riley’s ad, ""On Our Side,"" starts with a photo of Starr and a pretty Hawaiian view in the background. A female announcer, backed by a breezy ukulele, says: ""What’s not pretty? The ethics commission ruled he broke the law by letting lobbyists foot the bill."" (There also appears to be a pork chop dressed up to resemble a pineapple on the table.) But it’s not true. The state ethics commission did fine Starr in 2007 -- but not for going to Hawaii on the dime of a lobbying group. Rather, Starr was fined for failing to disclose the 2002 conference on annual disclosure forms filed with the state. At the time, it was perfectly legal for lobbyists to treat legislators to such trips and for legislators to accept them. The distributors, led by lobbyist Paul Romain, paid about $18,000 in 2002 and in 2004 to fly, feed, shelter and entertain a total of seven state legislators at two conferences. Starr attended the four-day conference with his wife. The ethics commission fined him $300 for not disclosing that trip and another education trip to Israel paid by another organization. Starr said at the time that he didn’t report the trip because the lobbyist, Romain, told him he didn’t have to. He amended his reports, showing that the beer and wine distributors paid $961 for airfare, $1,007 for his hotel room, $300 for food and beverages and $250 for golf. Molly Woon, a spokeswoman for Senate Democrats, defends the statement. Perhaps PolitiFact Oregon is overthinking the issue? ""He broke the law for taking a lobbyist-paid trip; you can say more, but that's the basic fact,"" she said. We have to disagree. Starr broke no laws or ethics rules by taking the trip at a lobbyist’s expense, which is what the Democrats’ ad claims. What Starr did wrong was fail to report the trip. The statement is False.

187,pomt-07731,"""Most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay.""",true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/02/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-most-federal-emplo/,"In an interview with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, NBC's Meet the Press host David Gregory zeroed in on the issue at the heart of the union showdown. ""What's so wrong with...collective bargaining?"" Gregory asked. Walker began with a comparison to federal employees. ""Well, our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today,"" Walker said. ""Under Barack Obama, he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay. So what we're asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has."" Whether Walker's proposal is less restrictive than what the federal government has today is a matter of opinion (and we'll explain why later), but we were curious whether Walker's was correct that most of the roughly 2.8 million federal workers do not have collective bargaining rights to negotiate pay and health or pension benefits. We turned first to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) which represents 600,000 federal government workers in 65 agencies, including the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Social Security, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is the largest federal employee union. It's true, said Beth Moten, legislative and political director for AFGE, that most federal employees don't have collective bargaining rights over pay and benefits. ""So what's the point?"" Moten asked. ""Should employees in Wisconsin be treated as badly as federal employees are?"" There are some exceptions to this rule. Air traffic controllers, for example, can bargain over wages under a 1996 law that granted full bargaining rights to a number of federal workers covered under the Federal Aviation Administration, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor expert at Cornell University. Some also point to the U.S. Postal Service, which has nearly 600,000 career employees, most (but not all) of whom have collective bargaining rights for pay and benefits. But theirs is a somewhat different situation. Although the U.S. Postal Service reports to Congress, it is an independent agency of the United States government. Unlike the private sector, explained U.S. Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders, postal employees cannot strike, nor can management lock them out. Walker said ""most"" federal employees. And by that measure, he is correct, Bronfenbrenner said. ""Unlike all the other state, county and municipal workers in the country who have collective bargaining rights, federal workers have their pay and benefits set by Congress,"" Brofenbrenner said. ""But federal workers can bargain over terms and conditions of employment besides pay and benefits. ""This has not created stable labor relations in the public sector by any means,"" she said. ""Instead it has meant that senators and congressional representatives with large numbers of federal employees in their districts end up fighting to have money put into bills for federal workers in their districts the same as if they were lobbying to get money for a large federal contract. Thus, instead of being done in the very open transparent process of state and local public sector bargaining it is all done at a higher level, mostly behind closed doors, but the money still is getting there, just not as equitably as it would if there were collective bargaining."" Moten, of the American Federation of Government Employees, also stressed that federal employees do have collective bargaining rights over working conditions. And that's an important right. It affects vacation time, work hours, safety issues -- all sorts of things important to workers. Under Gov. Walker's plan, collective bargaining for state workers would be limited to base pay rate (and raises would generally be limited by the rate of inflation). In a fact-check our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin did regarding limiting labor negotiations to only wages, they quoted Candice Owley, president Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, who said wages are only part of what’s important to nurses when they negotiate with hospitals. ""We spend very little time these days on wages and a whole lot of time on working conditions,"" she said, such as seniority, schedules, the length of shifts, and what happens when a nurse is assigned to a different department. Said Owley: ""We bargain every kind of working condition imaginable."" Bottom line, negotiations over working conditions are important, and so Walker's larger point -- that he is asking for ""something less restrictive than what the federal government has"" -- is debatable. But in saying that most federal workers don't have collective bargaining rights to benefits and pay, though, Walker is accurate. Although there are some federal workers who have collective bargaining rights for benefits and pay, ""most"" do not. And so we rate his comment True.",None,Scott Walker,None,None,None,2011-03-02T10:56:02,2011-02-27,['None']

""Seen those TV ads attacking me? They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck,"" she said in reaction to the ad paid for by Americans for Job Security. ""You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself,"" Norton says in her own ad. ""Here's the truth: In state government, I cut budgets, cut programs and reduced staff,"" Norton continues. ""Ken Buck's Office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent. We need a senator who's actually cut spending, and has the backbone to stand her ground."" The ""shady interest group"" Norton refers to is an outfit called Americans for Job Security. What they had to say about her wasn't so nice, either. ""Our country is at the brink,"" a narrator says. ""Colorado families and workers need relief -- yet Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions. And Jane Norton's record on government spending? The state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years. Record taxes and reckless spending has cost Colorado jobs. Call Jane Norton, tell her no more tax hikes and big government spending."" Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from Republican Party leaders. Buck, on the other hand, is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement. There are a lot of facts to sort through here. In this check, we're going to look at the tax increase charge against Norton. We'll examine Americans for Job Security's claim about an increasing bureaucracy in another report, and Norton's charges against Buck in still another report. Americans for Job Security isn't a typical political action committee. It's organized as a business league 501(c)(6), which means its ads are limited to issue advocacy and that the group isn't required to publicly disclose its donors. The group's website says it favors ""free markets and pro-paycheck public policy,"" and it has a reputation for working against unions. Still, it was fairly easy for us to reach the president of Americans for Job Security, Stephen DeMaura and ask him about the group's claims, specifically that Norton ""supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions."" He said the group has not coordinated with Buck and that Norton should address the ad's substance. ""Rather than wasting time with empty attack ads, she should respond to the claims and discuss them,"" DeMaura said. What Americans for Job Security calls the ""largest tax hike in Colorado history"" is actually subject to debate; some people contend it wasn't a tax increase at all. Let's start with a brief primer on Colorado tax history. Our story begins in 1992, when Colorado voters approved a Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, popularly known as TABOR. The measure said the government can't spend tax money collected under existing tax rates if revenues grow faster than inflation and population. Instead, the government had to rebate that money to taxpayers. These rebates applied to many types of taxes and business fees, but it primarily affected income and sales taxes. TABOR also required any tax increases to be approved by voters. By 2005, the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights had curtailed government spending to the point that some people felt basic services were being hurt, particularly for education. So voters were asked to approve Referendum C, allowing government to stop refunding excess revenues for the next five years. The measure drew bipartisan support from Colorado's elected leaders, including then Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, as well as his lieutenant governor -- Jane Norton. Anti-tax groups vehemently opposed the measure, saying it was a betrayal of TABOR. But voters approved Referendum C with 52 percent of the vote. Norton explained her support for the referendum in March 2010 to Fox 31 KDVR of Denver. ""Referendum C is actually the Taxpayers Bill of Rights in action,"" Norton said. ""TABOR allows for people to vote. And in this case, it was: do you want your tax refund to go -- it was a five-year time out -- and 52 percent of the people said yes, we will forgo our tax refund to help pay for essential services."" Her campaign also told Denver's ABC 7NEWS that the referendum was ""an unfortunate consequence of the worst recession in state history. Passing it meant the state did not have to close colleges, let prisoners out early, or cut services to the elderly."" For our fact-check, we also wanted to determine whether Referendum C was actually the ""largest"" increase in tax revenues in Colorado history. We wondered, for example, if Referendum C was proportionally larger than Colorado's adoption of a 4 percent income tax in 1937. We looked, but we couldn't find any analysis comparing the two measures. Natalie Mullis, chief economist for Colorado Legislative Council staff, which provides policy analysis for the Colorado Assembly, said she's gotten the same question from Colorado officials, but no definitive answer exists. She did say that Referendum C was the only significant increase in tax revenues since 1992, when TABOR passed. The Americans for Job Security ad says in a graphic that Referendum C raised $6 billion. We asked Mullis about this; she said that the number was likely based on projections before the economic downturn started in 2008. The measure has actually generated about $3.7 billion, all of that in the three years right after the bill was passed. There were no extra revenues generated for 2009 and 2010, she said, due to the economic downturn. Americans for Job Security said that ""Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history."" If the issue is just Referendum C, then yes, Norton supported it. But there are a number of qualifiers to that ""yes"": The evidence is not conclusive that it's the largest tax increase in Colorado history, though certainly it's the largest in recent years. Also, technically speaking, the measure didn't increase tax rates -- it ended rebates, though that does mean less money in people's pockets. Finally, Norton supported a ballot issue on which Colorado voters had the final say and ultimately approved. Given these facts, we rate this statement Half True.",None,Americans for Job Security,None,None,None,2010-07-26T16:55:10,2010-07-09,['Colorado']

Barton, a former party vice chairman, levels nearly 20 charges in his letter, including: ""Powerful Houston Democrats Sylvia Garcia (Democrat county commissioner in Harris County) and Elyse Lanier (wife of the former liberal Democrat mayor Bob Lanier) sponsored a Democrat fundraiser for Speaker Straus with numerous Democrat officials and high-ranking union officials."" Democrats passing the hat for the Republican speaker? We wanted details. Barton subsequently told us in an e-mail: ""I knew several of the key Democrats who put it together (including the head of the union based in Houston who was a principal in the event) and I also heard about it from influential business leaders who were invited to the event by Garcia and Lanier."" He said guests were summoned by phone or e-mail. Straus’s spokeswoman, Tracy Young, confirmed that Straus raised money for his campaign at a May 4, 2010 party held at the Laniers’ Houston home. Young said, though, the event was hosted by Harris County’s entire House delegation—not just Democrats. Also, she said, Garcia, the county commissioner, did not attend. We reached Garcia, who said she was invited to the party, but couldn’t attend -- nor did she call or e-mail anyone to invite them. Barton’s suggestion that she did so, Garcia said, ""is just not true."" Asked if she’s a Straus supporter, Garcia replied: ""Not really ... The only campaign I am worried about is the Sylvia Garcia re-election campaign."" By e-mail, Young forwarded a document inviting recipients to the ""Bayou Tribute to Speaker Joe Straus."" Under ""Honorary Host Committee"" it lists 29 Houston-area House members, 17 Republicans and 12 Democrats. Young also shared a document titled ""Host Committee"" listing more than 30 sponsors of the event including Bob Perry and tort-reform advocate Dick Weekley, Houston homebuilders and major GOP donors; super-lobbyist Mike Toomey of Austin; beer distributor and donor John Nau of Houston and political action committees for law firms, pilots and oil and energy-related firms. The listed sponsors include a PAC for the United Transportation Union. The Laniers are among eight identified underwriters of the party. While mayor of Houston, Bob Lanier was viewed as a Democrat, though the office is filled via non-partisan elections. The May event at the Lanier’s home, Young said, ""wasn't a Democrat(ic) fundraiser - it was a bipartisan fundraiser."" How does all this add up? Without a subpoena, we can’t determine whether Garcia invited others to the fundraiser, though it appears she did not attend. The rest of Barton’s statement is notable for what it leaves out. For instance, it’s fair to say the Laniers sponsored the party. But so did more than two dozen other backers, including GOP benefactors. While ""numerous"" Democratic officials were listed as honorary hosts, so were many Republican officeholders. As for ""high-ranking union officials,"" we identified one union’s role. On the other side of the political spectrum Barton did not mention hosts such as Anadarko Petroleum PAC. That committee’s parent company is a partner BP oil well that blew in the Gulf of Mexico. It’s also the biggest single corporate donor to Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. We weren’t given a list of guests so we could not assess their partisan affiliations. At the least, the Straus event does not appear to have been planned as the Democratic fundraiser Barton portrays.

190,pomt-07811,"For thousands of public employees, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill would ""take away any say they have in the workplace, and eliminate their union.""",half-true,/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/17/afl-cio/wisconsin-afl-cio-says-gov-scott-walkers-budget-re/,"Labor experts agree that Gov. Scott Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees is a dramatic departure from Wisconsin’s labor-friendly past. The Wisconsin State AFL-CIO has launched TV and radio spots condemning the plan while the Wisconsin Club for Growth is airing a TV ad supporting the changes. We’ll look at the Club for Growth ad in a separate item. The TV ad from the AFL-CIO centers on this message, delivered by a narrator: ""There’s now a move under way in Madison to take away the rights of thousands of teachers, nurses and other trusted public employees. A bill to take away any say they have in the workplace, and eliminate their union."" The visual backdrop includes lines from news articles about Walker’s plan. Among the snippets: A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that reads Walker’s plan would eliminate ""any say on benefits and work rules"" and an Associated Press story that reads ""all collective bargaining rights would be removed for state and local public employees."" Is the ad correct that the plan would ""eliminate"" union representation for thousands and wipe out ""any say"" they have through collective bargaining. When asked to back up the claims, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Stephanie Bloomingdale cited a Wheeler Report analysis that summarizes the budget-repair bill. Let’s take a deeper look at claim. Most of the debate has focused on what bargaining rights will be curtailed and the overall effect of the plan. Digging deeper, the bill does eliminate all bargaining rights -- wages, benefits, working conditions -- for specific categories of public employees. It would roll back the rights to organize unions and bargain for benefits for 30,000 University of Wisconsin System faculty and academic staff. Those rights were approved by Democrats in the 2009-'11 budget. Not all of the 30,000 have joined a union, though. So far, under those rights, faculty at two universities, UW-Superior and UW-Eau Claire, have formed unions. The measure would also repeal collective bargaining rights for some 5,000 home health care workers and for 2,800 employees of University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, including nurses. It would also eliminate current collective bargaining rights of licensed child care providers. All of that is also discussed in summaries of the bill and a letter from Walker to state employees. As for the other public employees -- a much larger group that includes schoolteachers, local government workers and about half of 76,000 state employees -- the bill would allow collective bargaining only on a base pay rate (not overtime or special pay issues), and on raises only within the rate of inflation. That means no bargaining on fringe benefits, working conditions, outsourcing, safety and other issues. So, the TV ad is correct on many of its main points. But it also overreaches. For instance, it suggests that the outright elimination of bargaining rights would cover all public employees. But they would not be completely eliminated for teachers outside of higher education, one group cited. Or for all ""other trusted public employees."" Indeed, the ad does not mention that there would be no change for firefighters, police and state trooper unions -- a fact that has drawn its own criticism. (Firefighters are part of AFL-CIO; police are not.) That incomplete information is underlined when the ad flashes a portion of a Feb. 10, 2011, Associated Press story, highlighting the words: ""All collective bargaining rights would be removed for state and local public employees."" That’s a selectively edited version of the AP story, which added a significant phrase to that line: ""except when it comes to wages."" The effect is to make Walker’s sweeping plan look even bolder. Let’s look at the rest of the message as presented in the ad. Would workers ""take away any say"" in the workplace, as the ad claims? Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said public employees would continue to have a say on working conditions -- not through unions, but through civil service laws. He noted those laws contain ways to file workplace grievances, and ensure employees are hired based on merit and experience, and are fired only for just cause. But civil service systems are not in place at all Wisconsin municipalities and leave a lot of workers uncovered, according to Andrew Phillips, general counsel for the Wisconsin Counties Association. For instance, about one-third of counties have no civil service system, and of the two-thirds that do, many only apply to deputy sheriffs, he said. The Legislature was considering changes to address this. What about the question of whether the unions would be eliminated? Clearly, some workers would have the right to organize directly eliminated, while many others would not. Bloomingdale, the AFL-CIO official, acknowledges that the bill before the Legislature does not directly eliminate all subjects of collective bargaining -- but nearly all of them. She argues the bill’s provisions overall discredit the unions’ role and therefore endanger them. One example she cites: Raises for unionized workers would be capped at inflation, but pay for nonunion employees is not. That disparity would hurt union membership, Bloomingdale said. Other aspects of the bill: As Walker noted in his letter, employers would be prohibited from collecting union dues on behalf of the unions, members of collective bargaining units will not be required to pay dues, and there would have to be a vote every year on the status of the union. We asked experts including academics and lawyers on both sides of labor-management talks about the assertion that -- on a practical basis -- the plan would mean the death of public employee unions. James Scott, a management-side attorney who represents Milwaukee County, said the changes are dramatic, but not unprecedented. He said nine states totally prohibit collective bargaining for public employees, and 10 others restrict it to police/fire, or teachers or state employees. His view of how life would be under the proposal: ""There isn’t much utility in belonging to a public sector labor union other than perhaps the social side of it,"" Scott said. He said calling it a death knell for unions might be ""a little bit"" too strong, but not much. Timothy Hawks, whose law firm represents municipal and state employees, said if the bill goes through as drafted ""you have busted every (public employee) union in the state."" A state official with a stake in both sides of labor disputes, Peter Davis, general counsel at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, said it was a ""fair prediction"" public sector workers would walk away from paying dues. Cheryl Maranto, chairman of the management department at Marquette University’s College of Business Administration, said the bill would have the effect of ""totally eliminating public sector bargaining in the state"" by rendering the unions ""irrelevant and powerless."" In the historical view, she said Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, overreached with pro-union moves and now Walker is going too far in the opposite direction. Let’s get to the bottom line. The AFL-CIO ad claims ""thousands"" of workers, including teachers, would lose all say in the workplace and see their union eliminated under Walker’s budget-repair bill. The measure would eliminate bargaining rights for some groups of public employees, including nurses and teachers in higher education. That total tallies out to ""thousands,"" but the ad presents the question as if all public employees would lose all bargaining rights. It even selectively shortens a news account to underline this point. That is an overreach, at least as an immediate consequence of the bill. As for the future, three of our four experts agreed with the union contention that it could be the end result in the future. The fourth felt it was only a small stretch. The PolitiFact definition for Half True is: The statement is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s what this ad does. And that’s the ruling: Half True.",None,AFL-CIO,None,None,None,2011-02-17T14:24:58,2011-02-17,['Wisconsin']
191,pomt-01348,"Says Jeanne Shaheen has ""voted with the president 99 percent of the time.""",mostly true,/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/21/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-jeanne-shaheen-voted-president-99/,"It’s become a go-to line of Scott Brown’s campaign to win a New Hampshire seat in the U.S. Senate -- so much so that he repeated it several times during an hour-long debate on Oct. 21, the first televised face-off of the campaign. Shaheen, Brown said just seven minutes into the debate in Concord, ""has in fact voted with the president over 99 percent of the time. What does that mean to people in New Hampshire? It means she was the deciding vote for Obamacare. … She’s also voted to put in place policies where we have more and more gridlock by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time."" Brown has delivered variations of this claim so frequently over the past few months that anyone in New Hampshire who’s been plugged into an electronic device has surely heard it. It’s been a mainstay of Brown’s ads in a frenzied air war -- so far in the race for U.S. Senate, more than 10,000 ads have aired costing, more than $7 million. PolitiFact New Hampshire looked into a version of this claim last March, after the New Hampshire Republican Party released a web video titled ""99 Percent."" It claimed that Shaheen consistently supports the president and ""votes with Obama 99 percent of the time."" The ad was launched before Brown had officially declared himself a candidate in the race. Here, we’ll look at Brown’s claim that Shaheen has ""voted with the president 99 percent of the time."" (Last year PolitiFact New Hampshire checked the claim that Shaheen was the deciding vote for Obamacare and ruled that Mostly False.) Brown’s charge carries some weight. Even though Obama won New Hampshire twice, a majority of residents (55 percent) now disapprove of his job performance, and his signature legislative accomplishment -- the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare"" -- is opposed by 52 percent of the people in the state, according to findings from an Oct. 10, 2014 Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Democrats across the country have faced similar critiques from Republicans; PolitiFact has frequently checked such claims and found them to have varying degrees of accuracy. Obama himself acknowledged the strategy during a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014. ""Now, I am not on the ballot this fall,"" Obama said. ""But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them."" During the debate, Brown even quoted the president to drive home his point. Of course, most politicians fall in line with the president when their party controls the White House. Still, we decided it would still be useful to dig into Shaheen’s voting record to see whether Brown was correct. When we checked this claim previously, we asked the NHGOP for evidence. Executive director Matt Mowers pointed us toward Congressional Quarterly’s annual presidential position votes report. CQ, a news service that covers Capitol Hill, examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow for comparisons. One of those ways is an annual examination of presidential support -- the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked out a position. The 2013 CQ analysis shows that, when you look at the pool of votes in which Obama took a clear position, Shaheen’s vote matched the president’s stance 99 percent of the time. Still, there’s more to that number than meets the eye. In 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes -- about one third. WMUR political reporter James Pindell further analyzed the figures and found that 70 of those votes involved presidential nominations -- to positions that ranged from Secretary of State John Kerry to a variety of federal judgeships. The remaining 38 involved some type of public policy, including seven on immigration, four on gun policy, and five budget bills. The only time Shaheen voted against Obama in 2013 came on a bill involving an Internet sales tax, Pindell reported. We found similar figures across CQ reports since Shaheen took office, which coincided with Obama’s election to his first term. CQ put her voting with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year. Overall, during the five years since Shaheen took office, Shaheen’s votes have aligned with the president’s position 98 percent of the time. That’s pretty close to the 99 percent figure, however, it’s important to note some limitations of judging Shaheen’s support for the president based solely on the CQ analysis. Shaheen communications director Shripal Shah noted that the senator had broken with Obama on some issues that do not come to a vote; these are not reflected in the CQ tally. For instance, Shah noted that Shaheen spoke out against a new round of military base closures, an idea the Obama administration advanced in budget proposals, and she opposed a proposal floated by the president to change Social Security benefits. There are also other ways to measure Shaheen’s voting tendencies. OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service, found that in 2013, Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 percent of the time. That’s less frequently than the average Democrat in the Senate, putting her on the bottom half of the list. Finally, in June 2013, Shaheen was featured as a ""Bipartisan Champion"" by the Bipartisan Policy Center for her work on energy efficiency legislation. ""It's disingenuous to draw conclusions about Sen. Shaheen's record by only looking at a small number of votes,"" Shah said. Our ruling Scott Brown said Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time. Brown has credible support for this claim -- in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as the president 99 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. That wasn’t much different than earlier years in the Senate -- overall, her votes have aligned with Obama’s 98 percent of the time since she took office. Still, the CQ ratings address a fraction of all issues facing Congress. Obama only took a clear position in about one third of the Senate votes, and in some issues that didn’t come to a vote, Shaheen broke with the President. Still, Brown’s claim about Shaheen isn’t far off. We rate it Mostly True.",None,Scott Brown,None,None,None,2014-10-21T22:22:25,2014-10-21,['None']
192,pomt-02446,"Says Debo Adegbile ""was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals"" and ""was abruptly withdrawn by the administration.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/27/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-barack-obama-previously-nominated-/,"President Barack Obama’s pick to head the Justice Department’s civil rights division has dredged up a decades old controversy surrounding Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black radical convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer. Obama nominated Debo Adegbile to be an assistant attorney general in November. Adegbile previously served as director of litigation at the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., co-authored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal with Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams on Feb. 24 that said Adegbile was not fit for the post because he attempted to ""seize on (the Abu-Jamal) case and turn it into a political platform from which to launch an extreme attack on the justice system."" In 1982, Abu-Jamal was found guilty of murdering a Philadelphia police officer in a case that garnered national attention. The case went on for many years. In 2009, Adegbile was at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund when it filed an amicus brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Abu-Jamal’s sentence was invalid because the jury was racially biased. Later, Adegbile was one of several lawyers to represent Abu-Jamal when prosecutors tried to reinstate the death penalty. Abu-Jamal is serving a life sentence without parole. But it was Toomey’s final salvo calling on Adegbile to withdraw his nomination that caught our attention. ""Only three years ago, Mr. Adegbile was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Months later that nomination was abruptly withdrawn by the administration. That would be the best course here."" At PolitiFact, we won’t debate Adegbile’s credentials for this important position, nor weigh in on a decades-old controversy. But whether Adegbile was previously nominated by Obama for a position is something we can, and will, look at. Nominate vs. consider We perused through the record of presidential nominations. Adegbile’s name doesn’t appear prior to his most recent nomination to the Justice Department. So we then turned to Toomey’s office. They immediately conceded their error. ""We should have written that he was under consideration,"" said Elizabeth Anderson, a spokeswoman for Toomey’s office. ""He was not nominated."" Presidents consider nominees all the time. Some considerations are more public than others. Former United Nations ambassador Susan Rice, for example, was publicly ""considered"" to be the secretary of state by Obama, but her name was never formally submitted for nomination after Republicans lined up against her. In the case of Adegbile, the Washington Post reported in 2011 that Obama ""asked the American Bar Association to evaluate the credentials of Debo Patrick Adegbile, director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit."" More recently, the Los Angeles Times reported that ""Florida lawyer Ben Hill, who was chairman of the bar association committee, said in an interview that Adegbile's name was withdrawn before he was rated by the group."" Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee asked Adegbile this year why his name was withdrawn in 2011. Responding to a question submitted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Adegbile wrote: ""I withdrew myself from consideration for a nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit based upon my personal, professional and practical assessment that my family’s best interests were served by my decision to remain in my position at the NAACP LDF in New York at that time."" In his op-ed with Williams, Toomey said Adegbile’s nomination was ""abruptly withdrawn by the administration."" But Adegbile contends it was his own doing. A spokesman for the White House also said Adegbile took himself out of the running. Toomey’s office pointed to a Washington Post story (which is actually a wire version of the aforementioned L.A. Times article) where it was reported that ""the White House later withdrew his name."" Finally, it’s worth noting that Obama has had a tough time filling U.S. Court of Appeals seats in the D.C. Circuit. It’s widely considered a stepping stone to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Republicans have repeatedly blocked his nominees. When the Senate Democrats invoked the so-called ""nuclear option"" to change Senate rules for confirming presidential appointments, it was to move ahead with three Obama appointees to the 12-member U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Adegbile’s confirmation for assistant attorney general now only needs a simple majority, which Democrats can arrange without help from Republicans. At the time he was being considered for the judgeship, Republicans could have forced a 60-vote threshold to confirm Adegbile’s nomination, if it reached that point. Our ruling Toomey, along with Williams, wrote that ""Adegbile was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Months later that nomination was abruptly withdrawn by the administration."" Adegbile was never nominated, a point Toomey’s office conceded. He was considered for the job by Obama, but only briefly and not formally. Presidents considered many names before making an official nomination. The distinction is important, because having to pull a nomination after it's formally made is a less frequent occurrence and a more significant setback for an administration.

193,pomt-08532,"The Chilean ""privatization scheme"" that Sharron Angle supports ""has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits, and millions of people with no coverage.""",mostly false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/04/patriot-majority-pac/patriot-majority-pac-conjures-chilean-dictator-att/,"It isn't often that U.S. campaigns venture into Latin American retirement policy, but the knock-down, drag-out battle for a Nevada Senate seat has done just that. It came up in an ad run by the Patriot Majority PAC, an obscure Washington-based group that appears to be spending big money on campaign advertising this year, primarily against Sharron Angle, the Republican who's challenging Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev. The ad seizes on a comment made by Angle about Social Security privatization during an Aug. 12, 2010, interview with KLAS-TV. Here's the narration: ""How does Sharron Angle plan to phase out Social Security? (Video of Angle saying, ""Chile has done this."") Chile? The country once led by Augusto Pinochet, the military dictator and human rights violator? Chile's privatization scheme has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits and millions of people with no coverage. (Angle: ""Chile has done this."") Privatize? Phase out? Pinochet? (Angle: ""Chile has done this."") Another day, and another bad idea from Sharron Angle. What's next?"" We were somewhat caught off guard by the ad sponsor's effort to use Angle's pension-policy positions to link her to a ""military dictator and human rights violator,"" complete with footage of goose-stepping Chilean soldiers on parade. But that connection, tenuous though it may be, didn't strike us as checkable in our conventional sense. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad fairly describes the nuts and bolts of Chilean retirement security. Is the ad justified in saying that ""Chile's privatization scheme has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits and millions of people with no coverage""? For many years, the Chilean system has been an inspiration to free-market advocates in the U.S. and elsewhere, so it's not surprising that Angle would have cited it. Here's some background on the system. Chile created its first Social Security-style programs in the 1920s, a decade or so before the United States did. But the government under Pinochet made a big change in 1981, transitioning all new workers -- as well as beneficiaries of the old, defined-benefit system who were willing to make the switch -- to a pension plan based on individual accounts run by private-sector investment managers. By now, almost all Chileans are enrolled in the post-1981 system. The program details have changed somewhat over the years, most recently due to a major round of changes in 2008. But the general outline has remained the same. Ten percent of workers' income is automatically deducted to fund their retirement, disability and survivor insurance, plus an additional charge for administrative costs. Employees can choose from among several government-approved private pension management companies, each of which offers five varieties of funds with varying degrees of risk. The funds and their approaches have been reviewed by a government regulator. Total assets in the system by the end of 2009 reached $107 billion in U.S dollars, or about 65 percent of Chile’s gross domestic product. Because the Chilean system has been a trendsetter, it has been studied extensively. Independent analyses suggest that over the long term, the level of support for retirees under Chile's system has been close or better than that in similar countries. But the Chilean system has also faced its share of criticism. Some of that criticism echoes what the ad says. Here's a closer look at the three issues raised in the ad. • Hidden fees. High fees have been a longstanding concern about the Chilean system. Due to lack of competition among private-sector money managers that participate in the system, these management companies' profits have been much larger than profit margins in other sectors of Chile’s financial services industry, wrote U.S. Social Security Administration researcher Barbara E. Kritzer in one paper. Over a full career contributing to the system, workers pay around 15 percent for administration, according to the International Organization of Pension Supervisors. This is in the middle of six Latin American countries and below five Eastern European countries with a Chilean-style individual accounts system. Several experts said that a series of government reforms in 2008 helped lower fees. In our reporting, we found that even supporters of the system acknowledged that fees have been a problem. But are they ""hidden,"" as the ad says? None of the handful of experts we spoke to said so. In fact, fees are more obvious to contributors in Chile than in other countries because they are levied on top of the mandatory contribution to private pensions. So while the ad is on track in its criticism of fees, it is wrong to say they are hidden. • Fewer benefits. Most studies have shown a long-term rate of return in the Chilean system of roughly 10 percent, which is high by international standards. But even if those rates of return are optimistic going forward -- whether because they were boosted by a period of unusually strong returns or because of insufficient participation by Chilean workers in the plan -- experts we spoke to agreed that for Chileans, the current system is preferable to the pre-1981 system. In fact, Pinochet's system remained in place after the transition to democracy and was retained by the socialist administration of Michelle Bachelet. (Bachelet lost power in March 2010.) Mauricio Soto of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has written that the old pension system was ""in crisis"" prior to 1981 -- paying more in benefits than it was receiving in contributions, with a projected actuarial imbalance greater than the country's gross domestic product. In addition, the patchwork system was ""poorly administered and inefficient"" and led to discrepancies in which ""white-collar workers could comfortably retire in their 40s, while blue-collar workers had to wait until their 60s to qualify for minimum retirement benefits."" There's no question that the current investor-based pension system carries risks, being subject to markets that can go up or down. But Chile's old system simply wasn't sustainable. ""It was unfunded and essentially a fantasy,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, a longtime champion of the Chilean system. So to suggest, as the ad does, that switching to a private system in 1981 resulted in ""fewer benefits"" is at best misleading. • Millions of people with no coverage. This charge is true -- but misleading for a couple reasons. Though the proportion of Chileans participating in the system has varied over time, the percentage has hovered around two-thirds, a rate similar to under the pre-1981 system. This is clearly less than the nearly universal coverage provided by the U.S. Social Security system. But Chile is also not nearly as rich as the U.S. Several experts we spoke to agreed that the coverage gaps have at least as much to do with the nature of the Chilean economy as with the design of the country's retirement system. Soto notes that low-income Chileans working in the underground economy account for about 30 percent of the workforce. These workers are typically not covered by the pension system unless they have previously worked in a legitimate business. Meanwhile, participation by the self-employed was for many years voluntary (and very low), though mandatory participation is being phased in by the 2008 reforms. Even among workers in traditional jobs, participation rates have usually topped out around 80 percent, with the percentage taking part at any given time even lower, since workers do not always keep up their contributions due to unemployment or a failure to comply with the law. This is a serious issue. As Kritzer notes, ""only a small portion"" of workers with less-than-perfect participation histories ""would have enough contributions to qualify for the guaranteed minimum benefit at retirement."" The 2008 reform addressed coverage concerns by introducing a universal pension paid to all Chileans over the age of 65 regardless of their contribution history. In addition, workers with small pensions from their individual accounts will have them topped up by the government. While we think it's fair for the ad to note that the Chilean system has holes, it's important to note that the pre-1981 system had holes too -- and that the nature of the Chilean economy plays at least as big a role in causing this problem as the retirement system itself. So where does this leave us? The ad demonizes the Chilean system in ways that we think are exaggerated. Fees are a problem, but they are not hidden. Rather than offering smaller benefits, the system has provided strong returns and is almost certainly sounder today than prior to 1981. And the coverage gaps that exist now are not unique to the privatized system and have a lot to do with specific factors at play in Chile. The ad does have a point that the Chilean system, at least if it's implemented without major differences, would likely be seen by most Americans as inferior to Social Security. The size of the coverage gaps in Chile's system, while understandable given Chile's economic situation, would be unacceptable to many, if not most, Americans. But this reasonable point is undercut by the ad's overheated rhetoric (""human rights violator""), imagery (the goose-stepping soldiers) and exaggerations about the substance of the Chilean plan. On balance, we rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

194,pomt-08582,"A $300 million stimulus allocation to Wisconsin ""has led to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of this state.""",false,/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/26/tom-nelson/tom-nelson-says-initial-stimulus-allocation-create/,"If you want to incite lively conversation during halftime of your next Packer party, ask how many jobs have been created by the federal stimulus. Let’s just say that opinions differ -- widely -- on how effective the stimulus has been. If your party-goers include Tom Nelson, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, he might chime in before anyone reached for another cheese curd. ""I have a track record of dealing with tough budgets as a vehicle, as a means to get people back to work,"" Nelson said in a radio interview that aired a week before his Sept. 14 primary win. ""And we were one of the first states in the country to pass and to implement a statewide stimulus that has led to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of this state."" That’s a lot of new jobs. Nelson, the majority leader of the state Assembly, used the term ""statewide stimulus."" But he told PolitiFact Wisconsin he meant the federal stimulus money that was distributed throughout the state. More specifically, Nelson said he was referring in the radio interview to the 2009 Wisconsin Act 2. That law, which Nelson voted for, was adopted in February 2009 by three-vote margins in both the Assembly and the Senate. It was a budget-adjustment measure that also directed an initial $300 million in federal stimulus funds to the state Department of Transportation. The money was for 47 projects, mostly on highways and freeways. So, for Nelson’s ""tens of thousands"" of jobs statement to be correct, that $300 million would have to have created at least 20,000 jobs. Did it? From the beginning, stimulus job-count figures have been beset with problems, in Wisconsin and around the country. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for example, found that an October 2009 report by the White House -- claiming stimulus money created or saved more than 10,000 jobs in Wisconsin -- was rife with errors, double counting and inflated numbers. In January 2010, the White House abandoned its method of counting jobs ""created or saved."" Instead, it began labeling jobs as having been funded by stimulus dollars. That isn’t to say the stimulus has not had any effect. A July 2010 paper by two economists -- one from the public sector and one rom the private -- said stimulus spending created 2.7 million jobs. But Nelson’s claim was not about all stimulus money, just that initial gush of cash given to the DOT. Nelson said he based his jobs statement on ""talking points,"" which he later said were based on two sources: The state website that tracks federal stimulus spending, which says 63,000 jobs have been created or saved. A November 2009 news release from state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison), which cites two statements about new jobs. One statement, from a contractors group and three unions, referred to a study that said the 2009 state budget would create more than 25,000 jobs. The other statement, from a transportation builders group, predicted the state budget and ""remaining federal stimulus dollars will support"" more than 28,500 jobs. But Nelson is mixing apples and oranges. The first talking point refers to jobs created or saved, when Nelson’s comment referred only to jobs created. What’s more, the 63,000 figure is based on all stimulus money given to the state as of August 2010, not the initial $300 million Nelson originally cited. The second talking point moves everything to a different source. It claims the state budget -- not stimulus money -- would create the jobs cited. Or the budget and remaining stimulus money. Again, Nelson is off point. There are hard numbers -- rather than predictions -- that Nelson could have used to gauge the effect of the $300 million given to DOT. PolitiFact Wisconsin analyzed figures from Recovery.gov, the federal website that tracks stimulus funds. The latest data available show that, through the first half of 2010, the $300 million cited by Nelson funded 1,203 jobs. There’s no way to know how many were created and how many were saved. But that’s miles away from Nelson’s original claim. OK, almost time for the second half kickoff. Where does all of this leave us? Nelson stated that an initial $300 million in stimulus money for road projects created tens of thousands of jobs in Wisconsin. As evidence, he turns to much broader measures -- jobs created or saved, all stimulus spending, the state budget and stimulus money. But the actual jobs figure from the initial allotment barely exceeds 1,200 -- and even that is a mix of jobs created and jobs saved. We rate Nelson’s statement False.",None,Tom Nelson,None,None,None,2010-09-26T09:00:00,2010-09-07,['None']

The July 1, 2013, rally took place the first day of the 2013 Legislature’s second special session, called by Gov. Rick Perry after a filibuster and demonstrators kept legislation restricting abortions from winning final Senate approval. Ponder, who works for an education technology company, said she wanted to show that the money likely to be spent on the special session could instead pay for measures she said would be more effective at reducing abortions: providing substantial contraception aids or paying 20 educators’ salaries for a year. We shopped around, comparing the costs of a special session to Ponder’s alternatives. Cost of a special session In a June 26, 2013, news story Ponder sent us, Waco ABC affiliate WXXV-TV said, ""Each special session could cost taxpayers more than $800,000,"" based on per-diem payments to legislators to cover their food and expenses. Other news stories we found typically gave either a per diem cost of $800,000, a per diems-plus-overhead cost of $1 million or both. Per diems are the biggest cost of Texas special sessions, which can last up to 30 days. At the current per diem rate of $150, with 182 lawmakers eligible (31 senators, 150 representatives and the lieutenant governor), 30 days of payments would equal $819,000. Not all lawmakers take the payments, though. June 18, 2013, news stories from the Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle indicated that during the year’s first special session, six or eight senators and 26 House members declined some or all of the payments. Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine told us by phone that Dewhurst turned down all per diem payments for both special sessions. If 33 lawmakers rejected the payment on days their chambers did not convene, the state might have shelled out $716,100 on per diems during the session. Other costs bring the total up. Legislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton told us by email that, wrapping in overhead costs such as utilities, security, printing and staff support, a 30-day special session could cost $1 million to $1.2 million. The pill Ponder emailed us a March 12, 2012, news story from The Week, a news magazine, that said generic-drug versions of birth control pills cost $9 a month and brand-name pills cost $90 a month. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy offers information at bedsider.org on the availability and costs of contraceptive options. The group is a nonprofit that produces research frequently used by teen pregnancy prevention organizations. The campaign’s site gives the same $9-$90 range cited in The Week’s article, with explanatory details. Oral contraception pills, containing hormones that prevent egg production or fertilization, are usually taken once a day. ""A woman without insurance using generic birth control pills will typically pay about $25 a month,"" according to the site. The group’s chief program officer, Bill Albert, told us by phone that information on the site is updated and current. With Medicaid or private insurance, according to the site, women can get the pill free or for just the cost of their co-pay (the fixed amount an insured patient pays out-of-pocket each time he or she gets a medical service). ""For most people,"" the Bedsider article said, the co-pay ""ranges from $5 to $35."" Federal funding makes free or low-cost pills available to many, the site said. Without insurance, generic pills at pharmacies can cost $10-$20 a month, the site says, or $20-$30 a month from Planned Parenthood, with name-brand pills selling for $60-$90 a month at pharmacies. The site says its information came from a survey of Planned Parenthood clinics and birth control manufacturers. Condoms Ponder told us she chose an average cost per condom of 50 cents by looking at items for sale on Amazon.com. Bedsider.org gives prices from a survey of online retailers: 30 cents to $1.54 apiece for male condoms at national chain pharmacies and 18 cents to 60 cents apiece at Walmart. As with the pill, the site said, condoms can be obtained for free or at reduced costs at clinics. But also as with the pill, there are more expensive options available. In a December 2009 article, Consumer Reports rated 22 types of condoms on strength, reliability and whether holes were present in the material; the best seven ranged from 71 cents to $1.10 each. To check options that are widely available, we visited a CVS pharmacy on South Congress Avenue and found prices from 79 cents to $4.35 apiece. Sexual health educators Ponder said she estimated from personal knowledge that the annual salary of an entry-level sexual health educator at a nonprofit organization might be about $35,000 to $40,000. Francine Gertz, human resources manager for the City of Austin’s health and human services department, told us by phone that the city employs health educators in programs such as its adolescent health initiative, which according to its website provides education and presentations for students, parents and others. The entry-level salary for a first-level public health educator -- a job that requires a four-year degree and two years of experience -- is $40,000, Gertz said, and a second-level public health educator with 13 years of experience might earn $54,000. Texas Workforce Commission spokeswoman Lisa Givens suggested by email that we look at a couple of the federal government’s occupation categories. One was ""health educators,"" which encompassed broad job titles such as community health worker and narrow ones such as early breastfeeding care specialist. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website, most people employed in this category nationwide earned about $53,000 a year as of May 2012. Job search website Indeed.com, whose data has been cited by Forbes and U.S. News and World Report magazines, says the average annual salary for a ""sexual health educator"" in Texas is $50,000 (compared with $52,000 nationally). Such averages are based, the site says, on ""salary information extracted from over 50 million job postings from thousands of unique sources over the last 12 months."" Adding up our results Now, let’s take another look at that sign. A 30-day special session might cost $716,100 to $819,000 in per diems alone; Ponder assumed an $800,000 cost. And how do the alternative expenditures on her sign price out? Like Ponder, we found estimates saying a month of oral contraceptive pills could cost $9 to $90, but we also read that a typical cost would be $25. Ponder went with the $9 figure and said $800,000 would buy 90,000 months of pills. We calculate that $800,000 would pay for 88,900 months of pills at $9 or 32,000 months at $25. That’s a difference of 4,700 years. To phrase it another way, $800,000 would buy 32,000 women a month’s worth of pills at $25 or 88,900 women’s pills for a month at $9. Condoms, Ponder estimated, would cost about 50 cents on average. With $800,000, we calculate, you could indeed provide 1.6 million 50-cent condoms. Using Bedsider.org’s range, we figure $800,000 would buy 2.7 million condoms at 30 cents each or 520,000 condoms at $1.54 each. To predict that $800,000 would pay for 20 full-time sexual health educators, Ponder said she estimated an annual salary for an entry-level position at a nonprofit at $35,000 to $40,000. That doesn’t contradict what we found, because the salaries we gathered covered a spectrum, from $40,000 for a city job requiring two years’ experience to $54,000 for veteran educators. We calculate that $800,000 would pay 20 educators at $40,000 or 16 educators at the Texas average salary of $50,000 listed by Indeed.com. Our ruling Ponder used a conservative estimate for the cost of the second special session, presuming it runs for the full 30 days. She used the lowest price we found for the pill, a mid-range price for condoms and a salary that doesn’t seem out of line for an entry-level sexual health educator position, so it’s probably true that under certain circumstances, you could pay for the items on her sign with $800,000 apiece. Then again, it might be fairer to estimate the pill at $25 a month instead of $9, which means you could only pay for 32,000 months of contraception, not the 90,000 months she cited. And unless you only wanted to hire newly-graduated sexual health educators, you might have to pay them more like $52,000 per year, which would cover 16 instead of 20 educators. So an adjusted version of the sign might read: ""$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 32,000 months of the pill, 16 full-time sexual health educators"" instead of ""$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 90K months of the pill, 20 full-time sexual health educators.""

196,pomt-02673,"Marriage ""decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent.""",mostly true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/09/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-marriage-decreases-probability-ch/,"On the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s announcement of the War on Poverty, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gave a speech at an event titled, ""Income Mobility and the American Dream,"" sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. During the speech, Rubio made a claim about the relationship between marriage and poverty. ""Until at least a few decades ago, our economy proved sufficiently dynamic and innovative to replace old jobs with new ones, but that hasn't been happening in recent years,"" Rubio said. ""Social factors also play a major role in denying equal opportunity. The truth is that the greatest tool to lift people, to lift children and families from poverty, is one that decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent. But it isn't a government program. It's called marriage."" He continued, ""Fifty years ago today, when the War on Poverty was launched, 93 percent of children born in the United States were born to married parents. By 2010, that number had plummeted to 60 percent. It shouldn't surprise us that 71 percent of poor families with children are families that are not headed by a married couple."" A reader asked us to investigate whether Rubio is correct that marriage ""decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent."" So we did. The claim appears to come from this article by Robert Rector of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Rector wrote, ""According to the U.S. Census, the poverty rate for single parents with children in the United States in 2009 was 37.1 percent. The rate for married couples with children was 6.8 percent. Being raised in a married family reduced a child’s probability of living in poverty by about 82 percent."" We concur that the Census Bureau data Rector cited -- from this table -- supports Rubio’s point. However, we have a couple of quibbles. First, there’s more recent census data, covering 2011. And second, there’s a bit of a mismatch between what Rubio said and what Rector wrote about. Rector was comparing female-headed single-parent households that include kids to married households that have kids. But Rubio didn’t specify that he was talking only about female-headed households that have kids. About one of every five single-parent households is headed by a man. If you use 2011 data and include single-parent households headed by either sex, the numbers come out a bit differently. The data show that 37.2 percent of single-parent households are in poverty, compared to 10.9 percent for married families with kids. That’s a 71 percent decrease in the likelihood of poverty, rather than 82 percent. In addition, these statistics are calculated by counting all the people, adult or child, living in households that include children, noted Michael Wiseman, a public policy professor at George Washington University. In other words, the numbers Rubio cited don’t speak directly to the likelihood of a child being in poverty, which was how he worded his claim. We should note that some critics have taken issue with the implications of the statistic Rubio cited. Philip N. Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, wrote on his blog, ""By the same logic, (Rubio) should have said, ‘The greatest tool for lifting children and families out of poverty is getting a job, which increases your income by $40,000 per year’ — because the median weekly earnings of full-time, year-round workers is $771 per week, which is $40,000 per year more than people with no jobs earn."" Meanwhile, the liberal group Think Progress pointed to a blog post from a few days earlier by the Council on Contemporary Families, a group of academics that study family policy, that said a ""nationally representative study of more than 7,000 women found that approximately 64 percent of the single mothers who married were divorced by the time they reached age 35-44. More importantly, single mothers who marry and later divorce are worse off economically than single mothers who never marry."" These may be valid points. However, in his comments, Rubio did not suggest that government pursue any specific government policies to directly promote marriage. He also said that being a two-parent family ""decreases the probability of child poverty,"" which sounds to us like a mathematical analysis of the existing data, rather than a suggestion that changing policies to encourage marriage will actually reduce poverty that already exists. For this reason, we are analyzing the mathematics that underlie his comment question, not the conclusions that can, or can’t, be drawn from the statistic. ""We take issue much less with the basic numbers than with the implication that marriage per se is what’s driving these differences in poverty,"" said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Our ruling Rubio said that marriage ""decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent."" Our research suggests that a more current and more accurate statistic to back up his claim would be a decrease of 71 percent. That’s lower, but not dramatically so.

197,pomt-14749,"Says Marco Rubio ""is the one for an open border.""",pants on fire!,/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-said-marco-rubio-open-border/,"U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio has been a target of some of his fellow GOP presidential candidates for his leadership on trying to change immigration laws in 2013. During the CNN debate in Las Vegas Dec. 15, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said that Rubio has opposed border security: ""He thinks he wants to be this ‘Oh I am great and strong on national defense,’ but he is the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless."" Is Rubio for an open border? In a word, no. An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio wasn’t for an open border in 2013, nor does he support it this year while running for president. 2013 immigration law In 2013, Rubio and seven other senators (dubbed the Gang of Eight) crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The bill required more border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status -- a path that included significant hurdles. As for border security, the bill included billions for border enforcement over a decade, for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee introduced the compromise amendment that included the beefed up security measures. The senators said that the additional border agents -- which would have doubled the number at the time -- would have cost $25 billion. At the time, Rubio told Fox News, ""If you look at what’s being proposed here, this is a dramatic expansion and improvement in border security that I hope will allow finally for this legislation to have the support it needs."" The Hill reported that Corker and Hoeven said Rubio played an active role in negotiating the amendment. In an interview on June 20, 2013, about a week before the Senate vote, Fox News’ Martha MacCallum asked Rubio if the bill would protect the border. ""Well, it’s a dramatic improvement in border security,"" Rubio said. ""It’s a major surge in border enforcement, and I think it’s important to explain why that’s necessary. Look, as I said before, America’s a special country, so special that people are willing to come here no matter what. Even some people are willing to risk their lives and do it illegally. And we’re compassionate about that, but we’re also a sovereign country. We have a right to protect our borders, every sovereign country does, and that’s why this is so critical."" The bill died after House leadership refused to bring the bill to a vote. Rubio still supports changing immigration laws, but on the campaign trail he has called for a piecemeal approach and emphasized that he thinks border security must be beefed up before other changes to immigration laws. During the debate, he repeated many of those points when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Rubio if he still supports a path to citizenship. Rubio said that Americans won’t trust the federal government to change immigration laws until illegal immigration is under control. ""We know what it takes to do that,"" Rubio said. ""It takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. It takes completing 100 miles of fencing. It takes a mandatory E-Verify system and a mandatory entry exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays."" A spokesman for Rubio pointed to this statement when we asked about Paul's claim. Paul's team pointed to Rubio's work on the Gang of Eight bill as support for Paul's statement. But that legislation did not create or even suggest open borders. ""If Sen. Rubio was really for open borders, the Gang of Eight bill wouldn't have been 1,198 pages long while doubling the size of border patrol,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, an expert on immigration at the libertarian Cato Institute. Steven Camarota, at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said that ""open borders is always an overstatement."" But the bill would have dramatically increased immigration, he said. Our ruling Paul said that Rubio ""is the one for an open border."" An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio doesn’t support anything like that. He was one of the authors of a 2013 bill that included billions for border security and more border agents. After that bill died in the House, Rubio has repeatedly said that the border must be secured before the Senate can revisit changing immigration laws. The idea that Rubio supports an open border is inaccurate and ridiculous, so we rate Paul’s statement Pants on Fire.",None,Rand Paul,None,None,None,2015-12-15T23:39:48,2015-12-15,['None']
198,pomt-03749,"""Right now, Texas doesn’t have an income tax and Oklahoma’s lowering their income tax rates, and guess what their severance tax is? Sky high.""",true,/ohio/statements/2013/apr/08/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-oklahoma-texas-have-sky-high-taxe/,"Gov. John Kasich pitched several changes to Ohio’s tax structure in his budget proposal for fiscal 2014-2015 that would, in part, allow reductions in the state’s individual income tax. Among those proposals was an increase to the state’s severance tax, a tax levied on oil and gas resources when they are extracted -- or severed -- from the ground. The change would target large producers engaged in horizontal drilling and raise an estimated $45 million in fiscal 2014 and $155 million in fiscal 2015. Kasich often has said the tax is too low. As energy companies tap oil and natural gas resources in the resource-rich Utica Shale formation in eastern Ohio, the governor has argued Ohio should reap a greater reward from nature’s bounty. While in the Mahoning Valley on March 21, the governor touted his budget plans, including the severance tax increase, to the Youngstown-Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce, and again in an interview with a Youngstown television station. ""Right now, Texas doesn’t have an income tax and Oklahoma’s lowering their income tax rates, and guess what their severance tax is? Sky high,"" Kasich told the interviewer. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s claim. We started with the first part of his claim about Texas and Oklahoma and income taxes. We quickly confirmed that Texas, indeed, does not have a state income tax. Oklahoma has a state income tax with seven brackets for individual incomes. The income thresholds for the brackets are grouped closely together, with the top taxing bracket kicking in for income over $15,000 a year. The median household income for the state for 2007-2011 was slightly below $44,300 a year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The rate for the top bracket for tax year for tax filers this year is $395 plus 5.25 percent of the amount over $15,000. That rate reflects a tax reduction of 0.25 percent from the previous year. So Kasich appears to be correct about the state income tax rates. But what about the two states’ taxes on oil and gas resources? Are they, as the governor said, "" sky high""? ""Sky high"" isn’t quantifiable. But we can look at how Texas and Oklahoma compare with other states, including Ohio. That picture, though, is somewhat muddied as the manner in which oil and natural gas production is taxed varies from state to state. Data from the National Conference of State Legislatures showed, though, that the taxes for 2012 in Oklahoma and Texas, while not the highest, were among the national leaders. Texas charges a 7.5-percent tax on the market value of natural gas. Oklahoma charges 7 percent on the market value, with provisions that reduce the rate if the price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) falls below $2.10. That has happened in just two months since 2000, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Texas collects a 4.6-percent tax on oil’s market value . Oklahoma collects 7 percent, with provisions for the tax to drop if the price per barrel falls below $17. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil hasn’t been that low in more than 10 years at Cushing, Okla., a major trading hub for crude oil. It has been above $90 per barrel all this year. How does that compare to other states? The NCSL data showed that gas taxes for both states are in the top 10, as was Oklahoma’s tax on oil. Texas’ oil tax was lower, but it also has the highest production, by far. In 2010, Texas accounted for nearly 26 percent of domestic oil production, more than double No. 2 Alaska. Ohio’s rates, by contrast, are much lower. Natural gas is taxed at 3 cents per MCF. The governor has proposed it be increased to 1 percent of the value of the gas extracted via horizontal wells. So, for example, if the average price is $3.35 per MCF at the wellhead, as the U.S. Energy Information Administration listed for December, the state would collect 3.35 cents per MCF, rather than the 3 cents at Ohio’s current rate. The collection would rise as the price of gas rises. Oil is taxed at 20 cents per barrel. Kasich’s proposal would increase that tax for horizontal wells to 1.5 percent of the price per barrel initially and to 4 percent after one year. So if oil commands a price of $90 per barrel, the state tax would generate $1.35 per barrel initially and $3.60 after the first year, rather than the 20 cents per barrel at Ohio’s current rate. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the governor’s point was that the taxes are ""sky high"" when compared to Ohio. And because oil and gas are exported out of those states, he said, the tax burden is also exported. ""Not all oil drilled in Texas is consumed in Texas,"" he said. ""Other states are exporting their tax costs to us. His proposal would allow Ohio to do the same."" Kasich’s description of income taxes in Texas (none) and Oklahoma (reduced) was correct. As for the other part of his claim, while ""sky high"" is somewhat subjective, the reality of the tax structure now is that the significantly higher tax rates on gas and oil in Texas and Oklahoma, when compared to Ohio, can generate revenues that are -- well -- sky high. Texas and Oklahoma are among the leaders for natural gas, but not tops. Oklahoma also has one of the highest oil rates. And at current prices, Texas’ tax on oil, the lower of the two states, would yield more than 20 times what Ohio’s current per-barrel tax raises. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s claim rates True.",None,John Kasich,None,None,None,2013-04-08T16:47:52,2013-03-21,"['Texas', 'Oklahoma']"
199,pomt-08592,Says more than 2 million Oregonians have received important medical services because of his health plan.,half-true,/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/john-kitzhaber/john-kitzhaber-says-2-million-people-got-health-ca/,"The Oregon Health Plan is John Kitzhaber’s baby. Oregon launched his groundbreaking health plan in 1994 when the state got special waivers from the federal government to change the way it handles Medicaid, the health insurance for the nation’s poorest people. Under Oregon’s plan, the state limits the services Medicaid pays for, with an emphasis on providing preventive and ongoing medical care. By limiting what services are offered, Oregon was able to expand the number of people who were covered. Kitzhaber came up with the idea and championed it during his years as a state senator and governor. When the plan launched in 1994, about 350,000 Oregonians were eligible. According to an official history of the plan published by the state, 250,000 already had Medicaid coverage. The expansion added 100,000 Oregonians who, until then, didn’t have health insurance. Today the health plan covers 523,000 Oregonians. About 20 percent of them wouldn’t be getting health insurance if not for the plan’s expanded Medicaid provisions. But the plan has struggled because of budget constraints and over the years cut back the number of people who are covered. Kitzhaber, a Democrat now seeking a third term as governor, talks proudly of his plan. On Aug. 15, 2010, in an interview on KQEN AM in Roseburg, he assessed the plan this way: ""The health plan I think in many respects has been a big success. Over 2 million Oregonians have received important medical services because of it."" We wondered about the ""2 million"" figure in a state that today has a population of 3.8 million. Campaign spokeswoman Jillian Schoene says the number comes from the Oregon Department of Human Services, which oversees the health plan. So we checked with the folks at the Oregon Health Plan. Sean Kolmer, the deputy administrator for the health plan’s office of policy and research, says the 2 million includes people who have been enrolled in the health plan at any time since 1994. He points out many people have come into the plan and left it over the years. He says the tally doesn’t double count. ""Those are unique individuals,"" he says. But the second part of Kitzhaber’s statement doesn’t hold up. Note that Kitzhaber told his radio listeners the 2 million health plan participants got coverage ""because of it."" With this cause-and-effect claim, Kitzhaber is saying the 2 million wouldn’t have received ""important medical services"" if his health plan hadn’t existed. And that’s not true. The majority of people in the plan would have had coverage under Medicaid anyway, and still would if the plan vanished tomorrow. How many of the 2 million would have received health coverage if the plan hadn’t existed? We asked the folks at the health plan and, at our request, they did a count. The answer: Kolmer says that 59 percent of those folks would have received Medicaid coverage anyway. That means 41 percent got coverage because of Kitzhaber’s health plan. Kitzhaber is indeed the creator of the Oregon Health Plan and -- as the records shows -- he can legitimately claim credit for expanding health coverage to about 820,000 people. Taking credit for the entire 2 million is a stretch. We find his claim Half True. Comment on this item.",None,John Kitzhaber,None,None,None,2010-09-24T11:41:24,2010-08-15,['Oregon_Territory']
200,pomt-06779,"Virginia has made ""no progress on jobs"" since Bob McDonnell took office.",false,/virginia/statements/2011/aug/18/democratic-party-virginia/virginia-democratic-party-claims-bob-mcdonnell-has/,"The Virginia Democratic Party has not let up on its criticism of Gov. Bob McDonnell’s jobs record. Their latest salvo is a web video attacking McDonnell’s performance. ""Despite the governor’s slick photo-ops and self congratulatory press releases, the reality is we have made no progress on jobs since he took office,"" the Virginia Democratic Party said in an August 5 statement about the video. So the commonwealth’s jobs picture hasn’t brightened at all since McDonnell took over? We wanted to see if that was true. To back up that assertion, Democrats pointed to a statement from the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a Richmond think tank that said Virginia had made ""no real progress"" on job creation since the end of the recession in June 2009. The think tank examines economic issues facing low and moderate income residents. The group’s president, Michael Cassidy, noted in a July 22 statement that Virginia had more than 3.6 million jobs back in June 2009 and had about the same amount in June 2011. But McDonnell didn’t take over as governor until the middle of January 2010. His first full month in office was February 2010 -- at which time the number of jobs was a bit lower. In February 2010, there were 3,595,600 jobs in the state, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In June 2011, the latest month for which figures were available, that had risen to 3,643,800. That means that since McDonnell has been governor, the state’s job rolls have increased by 48,200. The June 2011 employment numbers showed a drop of roughly 14,000 jobs from the previous month’s job figures, a fall-off that Cassidy noted had erased 23 percent of the jobs gained since February 2010. But even with that decline, there were still nearly 50,000 jobs gained overall since McDonnell took over. Democrats have used overall job counts to argue the employment situation has at least gotten somewhat better under President Barack Obama. In an August 5, 2011 news release, the Democratic National Committee noted that 2.4 million private sector jobs have been created over the past 17 months. The news release noted that the ""pace of recovery isn’t fast enough, but 2.4 million families are now better able to make ends meet."" Nationwide figures from the BLS show that from February 2010 to July 2011, private sector jobs rose 2.2 percent ending at 109.2 million. The total number of all jobs in the U.S. -- including government positions -- rose 1.5 percent during the same period ending at 131.2 million. Brian Coy, a spokesman for the Virginia Democratic Party, also pointed out that the percentage of the state’s working age population with a job is at the same point it was in February 2010. In February 2010, there were 3,891,279 people in Virginia who were employed, which was 64.3 percent of the state’s working age population of 6,049,306, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In June 2011, the number of people in Virginia with a job had grown to 3,951,327, but the size of the working age population also rose to 6,141,503. That meant the state still had the same 64.3 percent of its working age population employed. ""If you define progress as putting a greater percentage of our population to work (which seems like a fair definition to me), we haven’t made progress since Bob McDonnell took office,"" Coy said in an e-mail. Terry Rephann, a regional economist with the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said the percentage of people with jobs can stay constant even if there’s job creation in a state. A state like Virginia, for example, is a fairly typical southern state where the population is growing faster than in the northern states, he said. As a result, the number of people with jobs has to increase even faster to keep up with that relatively higher rate of population growth, Rephann said. Rephann said that the jobs environment in Virginia has improved a bit since the early part of last year. But Rephann also said that the number of jobs created since McDonnell took office isn’t very impressive. ""Even 40,000 in a (state) economy of this size is not really enormous job growth,"" Rephann said. ""But that’s the nature of the economic recovery that we’re in."" Virginia’s unemployment rate was at a peak of 7.2 percent at the start of McDonnell’s term. The number has consistently declined, and it was 6 percent in June 2011. The commonwealth’s jobless rate is one third lower than the 9.1 percent national unemployment rate. Virginia is tied with Hawaii and Iowa for the eighth lowest statewide unemployment rate in the country. Virginia’s percentage of working age residents with a job also compares favorably on a national stage. Nationwide, 58.2 percent of the country’s working age population was employed as of June 2011. We’ll also point out, as we often do with these stories, that economists repeatedly tell us governors take too much credit and receive too much blame for short-term performance over their state economies. A governor’s ability to affect brief business cycles is limited, economists say. To sum up: The state Democratic party said there has been ""no progress"" on creating jobs since McDonnell took office. While the Dems are correct that the percentage of the state’s working age population with a job was the same in June 2011 as it was when McDonnell took office, there is no getting around the fact that the state added 48,200 jobs. Or that the unemployment rate has dropped during his term. That it contradicts the Democrats’ blanket assertion that there has been no progress.

When we received a Thanksgiving news release from Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, our attention was immediately seized. In addition to holiday greetings, the release included three recipes DeWine credited to his wife, Fran. He said the recipes -- for crescent rolls, broccoli salad and ""Fran's carrot cake with lemon cream cheese icing"" -- are family favorites and part of a delicious and traditional Thanksgiving meal. Hoping it didn't look too obviously like we were pitching for samples, PolitiFact Ohio asked the attorney general how he backs up his claim of deliciousness. ""I think I would start with the rolls,"" he told us. ""Fran's been making these rolls for, well, we've been married for 45 years, and she's been making the rolls for probably 40. She took it from a recipe in one of her first cookbooks, and she modified it mainly by adding honey."" She also adds cracked wheat flour from the family farm because ""it embodies the spirit of the harvest,"" he said. ""The strongest evidence (of deliciousness) I would give,"" he continued, ""is if you would be there on Thanksgiving, or any other meal, to watch our grandkids wait for the turkey to come out of the oven. ""Fran takes the turkey out and puts the rolls in. Before they can actually get served, kids are taking rolls off the pan, burning their fingers to get them. I've seen them put as many as five on a plate."" The DeWines have 18 grandchildren, with a 19th on the way next month. They host 75 people for Thanksgiving. To feed them all, Mrs. DeWine makes 12 dozen rolls. ""They're to die for,"" her husband said. ""The best evidence is to watch people eat them. Even people who say they don't eat rolls like them. At any family gathering, really, people expect Fran to have them."" DeWine sometimes spreads them with red raspberry jam from his son, an organic farmer. To be really decadent, he said, he adds both jam and butter. We questioned whether that wouldn't be so good it's illegal. Exercising his prosecutorial discretion as the state's chief law enforcement officer, he assured us we would be on safe legal ground. He said the broccoli salad was a relatively new addition to the holiday menu that was added by a daughter-in-law. ""I'm not a great fan of broccoli per se, but in that combination it's very, very tasty,"" he said. ""It's a healthy, interesting mixture."" We asked him about the cake. At PolitiFact Ohio, we are well known as carrot cake fiends. ""The carrot cake is also a favorite of mine,"" he said. ""The frosting is very similar to a frosting my mother used to make on chocolate cake, a cream cheese with lemon frosting. When it comes out of the oven …"" PolitiFact Ohio didn’t press him to finish the description. We had heard enough to begin pondering how we could slip in for dinner. A family recipe in use four decades certainly is a tradition. And DeWine’s descriptions left us craving his wife’s cooking. We rate his claim of deliciousness as True. We’re sharing the recipe for Fran DeWine’s Favorite Rolls above. They would certainly enhance any holiday leftovers. You can find the others in his news release.

202,pomt-06820,"""George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes.""",half-true,/florida/statements/2011/aug/10/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-says-george-lemieux-voted-against-his-/,"As Adam Hasner and George LeMieux debate each other's conservative credentials in the race to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, Hasner's team has picked over LeMieux's brief time in the U.S. Senate looking for signs of weakness — er, uh, moderate leanings. The joys of primary politics. Thus, a Hasner news release from Aug. 8, 2011 -- the week after Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling and avoid default -- accuses LeMieux of being ""for tax-raising committees before he was against them."" It begins: ""After weeks of equivocation and avoidance of the debt crisis in Washington, Senator George LeMieux finally tweeted his displeasure in the closing hours of the debate. But while serving as Charlie Crist's handpicked U.S. Senator, George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes."" And concludes: ""Time and time again, Senator LeMieux's record shows he was willing to be a token Republican vote for the Democrats, and his vote to create a tax-raising task force proves it."" Consider us intrigued. In just part of a sentence — ""George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes"" — we saw three issues worth a look. • Did LeMieux vote against most Republicans and with Democrats to create a Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action? • Was that task force proposal ""strikingly similar"" to the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, sometimes called the ""supercommittee,"" created by the Budget Control Act of 2011? • Is the supercommittee being ""set up ... to justify massive tax hikes""? We'll note that LeMieux did indeed tweet unhappily on Aug. 1, 2011, saying the, ""Debt deal offers no significant debt reduction & no fundamental reforms to solve DC's spending addiction"" and linking to a short post on his website that the debt deal was ""no time for celebration."" Did LeMieux vote to create a Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action? LeMieux's record of support for a bipartisan committee known as the ""Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action"" is clear. He was one of 25 original co-sponsors of legislation in 2009 by Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., that would have created the task force. When it ultimately came up for a Senate vote as an amendment to an amendment to another bill in January 2010, the roll call at Senate.gov shows he voted for it. His ""Yea"" vote put him with about 40 percent of Republicans. The majority of his party colleagues voted against it. That supports Hasner's claim that he ""voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats"" to create the task force. But LeMieux wasn't exactly a ""token Republican vote for the Democrats,"" as Hasner's team put it. Fifteen of LeMieux's Republican colleagues joined him. The Democrats were as divided as the Republicans, though more of them supported the plan. Meanwhile, the final 53-46 Senate vote — seven votes short of the 60 required — understates earlier Republican support for the task force. Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell had called it the ""best hope for addressing the out-of-control spending and debt levels that are threatening our nation's fiscal future."" Then antitax activists attacked it for leaving the door open to tax increases, and President Barack Obama endorsed it the Saturday before the vote. Seven Republican co-sponsors withdrew their support. McConnell also voted against it, earning a Full Flop from PolitiFact. Which left LeMieux in his party's minority — but on a proposal with strong bipartisan roots. Was that task force proposal ""strikingly similar"" to the supercommittee? Hasner accuses LeMieux of a flip-flop, saying he was ""for tax-raising committees before he was against them."" But just how similar were the committees? In some key ways, they're the same. The supercommittee is ""certainly a descendant of the task force and the many other similar type(s) of special mechanisms proposed to do the hard work Congress refuses to do,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. ""... This is not a new idea."" The committee proposals both include members appointed by Democrats and Republicans, seek ideas to reduce the ""fiscal imbalance of the federal government"" and require Congress to fast-track recommendations to a vote with no amendments. But LeMieux's campaign points out a key difference: The 12-member supercommittee created by Congress requires just simple majority votes — for example, a single Republican could join six Democrats to endorse a plan. Meanwhile, the task force he supported required supermajority votes both by an 18-member committee and by Congress to implement its recommendations. ""This would have protected taxpayers since the commission's plan would have needed the support of at least four of the eight Republicans on the commission to guarantee a vote in the House and Senate,"" said campaign manager Brian Seitchik. ""This would make it highly unlikely that the commission's plan would be able to get sufficient Republican support if it raised taxes."" So, are the committees ""strikingly similar""? Yes, but arguably with enough room for LeMieux to explain why he might vote for one, but not support the other. Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction Goal To provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the long-term fiscal imbalance of the federal government, which may include expenditures and revenues To reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion from 2012-21, providing recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the short-term and long-term fiscal imbalance of the federal government Members 18 (10 Democrats, 8 Republicans) 12 (6 Democrats, 6 Republicans) Time before committee vote on recommendations 41 weeks 16 weeks Number of members required for passage 14 of 18 (78 percent) 7 of 12 (58 percent) Fast-tracking in House and Senate Yes Yes Amendments allowed No No Votes required to pass Congress Supermajority in each chamber Simple majority Is the supercommittee being ""set up ... to justify massive tax hikes""? Now we get to the crux of Hasner's campaign message, that LeMieux supported ""tax-raising"" committees before he opposed them. Did Congress create the supercommittee ""to justify massive tax hikes""? And was raising taxes the purpose of the earlier task force that LeMieux supported? Consider this a matter of vociferous debate. Neither the task force nor the supercommittee proposals require tax increases. The earlier task force plan explicitly allowed for the possibility, saying that recommendations may include expenditures and revenues. Meanwhile, the supercommittee legislation requires a $1.5 trillion reduction in the deficit but doesn't prescribe how to get there. Spending cuts? Tax increases? It's up to the committee, which doesn't have to be named until Aug. 16, 2011. In fact, depending on whom you talk to, tax increases are guaranteed, likely — or, in the case of the supercommittee, not even possible. Hasner's campaign cited a letter from antitax activist Grover Norquist, who opposed the earlier task force proposal. Norquist said that by relying on a committee that was not explicitly barred from raising taxes, tax hikes would occur. ""Every Democrat on the commission would insist on tax increases to 'balance' spending cuts in the recommendation. There is no conceivable scenario whereby the commission would issue a report that does not contain tax hikes,"" he wrote. George F. Will made a similar argument about the tax force proposal LeMieux supported: ""Substantively,"" he wrote, ""the task force would be a means of conscripting Republican participation in huge tax increases."" Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense disagrees with the premise that either committee was designed to justify tax increases. ""That's irresponsible fear-mongering, which is similar to those on the left saying the committee was established to slash Social Security or Medicare,"" Ellis said. He points out that only half the senators who voted against the task force proposal were Republicans. ""I don't think Sen. (Bernie) Sanders, I-Vt., was voting against the committee because he was afraid it would raise taxes,"" he said. Meanwhile, the supercommittee vote actually spawned days of debate about whether it would allow for tax increases at all, much less ""massive"" ones. (You can read some here: Sort of, Yes, Maybe) House Speaker John Boehner told his caucus it would effectively be impossible for the supercommittee to raise taxes. The White House disagreed. The debate turned on a technical question: How would $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction be calculated? Some said that, because the supercommittee legislation asks for estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, it would require using CBO's typical ""current law"" baseline — one that assumes the Bush tax cuts will expire in 2012 — as opposed to a ""current policy"" or ""plausible"" baseline that assumes that what's true now stays in place whether that requires an act of Congress or not. Others said the committee could request a different baseline. If a current law baseline were required, Democrats wouldn't get any credit toward the $1.5 trillion for stopping or limiting the Bush tax cuts, for example, which would be presumed gone. Even if they wanted to do it anyway, increasing tax rates would get sticky. ""The practical effect of this is that the bipartisan committee will be unable to make any recommendations regarding the Bush-era tax cuts,"" wrote Nick Kasprak of the business-backed Tax Foundation. ""For example, let's say the committee proposes, among other things, raising the top marginal tax rate 3 percentage points, from 35 percent to 38 percent, which would bring in some amount of revenue that counts towards their $1.5 trillion assignment. 'Hold on,' says the Congressional Budget Office, 'According to our current law baseline, that rate is set to go up to 39.6 percent in 2013 when the Bush-era tax cuts expire, so this is actually a tax cut, and it makes the deficit worse.' "" One more curveball: If the supercommittee deadlocks, or Congress doesn't pass what it recommends, the Budget Control Act includes an automatic trigger to cut $1.5 trillion across the board, split evenly between defense and everything else, and protecting just Social Security, Medicaid and veterans benefits. That's right: No deal means just cuts. The ruling Hasner's team said, ""George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes."" LeMieux did vote against the majority of Republicans, joining with Democrats in an attempt to create a Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action — though the proposal had more bipartisan support than Hasner's full news release suggests. Meanwhile, while the task force would have been substantially similar to the supercommittee just established by Congress, it's different enough that LeMieux could explain his change of support without a change of heart. Finally, it's a serious stretch to say the supercommittee was designed ""to justify massive tax hikes."" While tax increases are one plausible outcome, they aren't required, and depending on the baseline committee members choose, may not even be likely.

203,pomt-04712,"Says Gov. Chris Christie has embarked on a tour to ""demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest.""",false,/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/02/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-says-chris-christie-embarked-tour-de/,"Even before Gov. Chris Christie stepped on stage Tuesday night to deliver his keynote address at the Republican National Convention, New Jersey Democrats were criticizing the governor for exaggerating his success as the state’s chief executive. Barbara Buono, a Senate Democrat from Middlesex County who has said she is ""seriously considering"" a 2013 bid for governor, took aim at Christie in an opinion column published in Politico late Monday night for making ""wildly optimistic"" revenue projections to prove New Jersey can afford a tax cut. ""Being honest about the numbers would undermine the ‘Endless Summer’ tour that Christie has embarked on to demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest – regardless of whether the state can afford it,"" Buono wrote. Here, however, it’s Buono that’s not being forthright. Although Christie initially proposed in January to cut income taxes 10 percent across-the-board over three years, he backed off that proposal before the start of his ""Endless Summer"" tour. Christie now supports a plan based on a proposal from the Senate Democrats that would provide homeowners with an income tax credit based on their property tax bills. Under the governor’s original plan higher income filers, who pay more in income taxes, would have benefited more than lower income filers. But under the plan Christie now supports -- the plan he signed onto before kicking off his tour of New Jersey to blast Democrats for not approving a tax cut -- that’s not the case since some wealthy individuals would not even qualify for a tax cut. On July 2, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill increasing the state’s top income tax rate on millionaires to enhance property tax relief payments for certain residents. Christie suggested turning that legislation into a tax cut plan based on a proposal the Senate Democrats released earlier in the year. Under Christie's new proposal, homeowners who earn $400,000 or less in taxable income would receive an income tax credit based on their property tax bill. The credit would be phased in over four years, reaching 10 percent of the first $10,000 homeowners pay in property taxes. The maximum credit under the plan would be $1,000. To support the state senator’s claim, Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, pointed to a July 26 news article that quotes Christie saying: ""I'm fighting for the tax cut now because you know, businesspeople are making decisions now about whether they're going to expand next year. The Democrats say we'll get to it. We'll get to the tax cut in December or January. Well that's going to be too late for 2013. Those businesspeople are already going to be deciding where they're going to invest their money, where they're going to spend."" But Christie just says tax cut, not income tax cut. And still, he has publicly backed off his original proposal and put forth a plan based on a homeowner’s property tax burden. It’s also worth noting that Christie’s conditional veto also recommended restoring a cut he made during his first year in office to the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program which benefits lower income individuals. The conditional veto increased the state credit to 25 percent of the federal credit amount, up from 20 percent. Our ruling Buono said that Christie embarked on an ""Endless Summer"" tour to ""demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest."" Christie first proposed an across-the-board income tax cut that would have benefited higher income filers more than lower income filers. But Christie has since backed off that plan. Before the governor kicked off his ""Endless Summer"" tour, he signed on to a version of the Senate Democrats’ plan to give an income tax credit based on individuals’ property tax bills.

204,pomt-14588,"Says Donald Trump's conversion to pro-life beliefs are akin to Justin Bieber's, who said in the past that abortion ""was no big deal to him.""",false,/punditfact/statements/2016/feb/05/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-donald-trump-justin-bieber-once-s/,"What do Donald Trump and Justin Bieber have in common? Humongous hair? Big bucks? How about a case of abortion contortion? Sarah Palin compared their abortion stances during the Feb. 1 edition of CNN's The Lead. Jake Tapper asked the former Alaska governor and Trump supporter about Trump's turnabout on the issue of abortion. ""Donald Trump is somebody who has clearly had different positions on issues that he has today,"" said Tapper. ""He called himself very pro-choice. Now he says he's very pro-life."" ""I am so glad Mr. Trump has seen the light,"" Palin responded, saying it was sad that anti-abortion groups were giving the candidate a hard time about his switch when other people who have had a change of heart on the issue have been celebrated. She cited, as an example, singer Justin Bieber. Tapper didn't quite understand and, in essence, asked her, what do you mean? Bieber ""has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him,"" Palin said. ""He’s just one example."" We wondered whether the pop star really had the same type of conversion as Trump or whether Palin had gone overboard. Trump's change of position on the abortion question is well-established. When Trump was first considering a third-party presidential run in 1999, he said on NBC's Meet the Press that although he hated the concept of abortion, ""I am pro-choice in every respect."" By mid February 2011, when there was talk again that he would run for president, he declared, ""I am pro-life."" Whether the Biebs transitioned from abortion support to abortion opposition is not as clear. We contacted Palin through her political action committee and sought comment from Bieber through the office of his manager, Scooter Braun. We didn't hear back from either. So we decided to try to find out for ourselves. No pressure. The only reference to the abortion issue we could find was Bieber's interview with Rolling Stone, published in February 2011. He was 16 at the time. ""I really don't believe in abortion. I think (an embryo) is a human,"" Bieber told the magazine. ""It's like killing a baby."" When he was asked about abortion in cases of rape, his response was, ""Um. Well, I think that's really sad, but everything happens for a reason. I don't know how that would be a reason. I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that."" The rape comment in particular caused some controversy at the time, and since then Bieber has shied away from the issue. He got drawn back into it peripherally when his mother, Pattie Mallette, a born-again Christian, promoted a short anti-abortion film in 2013. Mallette had previously written of the pressure she experienced to have an abortion when she was 17 and carrying the now-pop superstar. The Chicago Sun-Times said in a Jan. 21, 2013, story that it had spoken with an unnamed ""longtime Bieber associate"" who claimed, ""I don't believe he agrees with his mom on this issue."" Some might interpret that to mean that Bieber is now pro-abortion — which would signal a new position on abortion that, sorry, does not fit Palin’s point. However, PolitiFact has a policy of not relying on unnamed or secondhand sources to speak for what others believe. Our ruling Palin said Bieber ""has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him."" At PolitiFact, we believe it's the responsibility of the person making a claim to provide the evidence to back it up. Palin didn't respond to our query. The only reasonable conclusion at this point is that Bieber hasn’t changed his position on abortion like Trump. Nonetheless, we never say never: If on-the-record evidence of Bieber supporting abortion prior to his Rolling Stone interview turns up, we'll consider a different ruling. Until then, Palin’s claim is not substantiated. We rate her claim False.",None,Sarah Palin,None,None,None,2016-02-05T14:35:53,2016-02-01,['Justin_Bieber']
205,pomt-07020,"Says that under City Council Member Randi Shade, Austin had the ""highest city debt per person in Texas.""",false,/texas/statements/2011/jul/06/better-austin-today-political-action-committee/austin-group-says-under-randi-shade-austin-has-had/,"In a mailer backing Kathie Tovo over incumbent Austin City Council Member Randi Shade, the Better Austin Today political action committee recently said: ""Under Randi Shade we have had ... the highest city debt per person in Texas."" Numero uno? Jeff Jack, the group’s chairman, told us the debt ranking traces to survey results posted online by the Texas Municipal League from asking cities to share their debt levels. Jack said that he added up each city’s debt, listed on the survey, and divided that by each city’s population to come up with per-person totals; Austin, he said, finished first, at $6,291 per person. ""There is quite a range when you start thinking about differences,"" Jack said. We turned next to the league, whose executive director, Bennett Sandlin, initially cautioned the survey results ""are solely the result of city self-reporting"" and have not been verified. At our request, the league took its survey results from 2008 through 2010 and calculated each responding city’s per-capita debt. Counting three types of debt -- general obligation, certificates of obligation and revenue-backed -- Austin ranked 10th among Texas cities in 2008 and 2009, at $5,643 per resident and $5,787, respectively, and ninth in 2010, at $6,291, Jack’s cited figure. Notably, much smaller cities showed greater per-person debt each of the years. In 2010, for instance, Johnson City and Galveston had more debt per person; the No. 1 per-person debt in the state appears to have been in Deport, which is 18 miles southeast of the East Texas city of Paris. So, Austin finished in the top 10 among cities that answered the survey, and it was by far the highest-ranking big city. In 2008 and 2009, cities with greater overall debt per capita topped out in population with Granbury, home to about 8,000 residents. Galveston, higher ranked in 2010, had 57,500 residents to Austin’s more than 750,000. However, Sandlin cautioned against making city-to-city debt comparisons that fold in outstanding revenue bonds. ""The reason is that, unlike general-obligation and certificates-of-obligation debt, revenue bonds are typically not payable by the citizens through property taxes, but rather by the users of city utilities, such as water or electric (services),"" he wrote. ""Many city utilities serve areas far larger than city limits, so those debts are being serviced by non-citizens and thus might not be a fair measure of how much debt the citizens bear."" In Austin’s case, Austin Energy, the city-owned electric utility serving residents of Austin plus the rest of Travis County and a portion of Williamson County, has more than $1 billion in outstanding revenue-backed debt and the city’s water utility, airport and convention center together account for more than $2 billion in revenue-supported debt, according to Art Alfaro, the city treasurer. Those debts, to rehash, are to be paid from revenue by the entities that issued them--and not from property tax dollars. Alfaro said in an interview that any fair city-to-city debt comparisons should be limited to general-obligation debt, the only kind backed by property taxes. Austin’s more than $800 million in this type of debt reflects bonds issued to build streets, libraries, parks and anything needed to run the city, he said, the vast majority approved by voters. Removing Austin’s revenue-backed debt changes its ranking considerably, the league’s survey results show. By this gauge, Austin was 208th among responding cities, at $871 per resident, in 2008 and 120th in 2009 and 2010, at $1,213 and $1,258, respectively. Not counting revenue-backed debt, among larger cities, Lubbock and Richardson had greater per-capita debt in 2010 and Houston’s per-capita debt was more than the debt for Austin in 2008 and 2009. By email, Jack said not counting revenue-backed debt doesn’t make sense: ""If a business entity has a cost increase it passes that cost along to the consumer. In the same way revenue bonds, though not going through the (city’s) general fund, increase the cost indirectly through higher utility rates, user fees and the like,"" Jack said. It ""all adds up … it is the total cost that must be considered."" Separately, we asked Standard & Poor’s, which bestows credit ratings to cities, how it would analyze the per-capita debts of Texas cities. Dallas-based analyst Horatio Aldrete said the firm puts Austin’s ""net debt""--less revenue-related debt but taking into account the general-obligation debts of overlapping jurisdictions such as Travis County and the Austin school district--at $3,664 per person. That’s compared to $3,600 in Dallas, $3,611 in Fort Worth, $4,700 in San Antonio and $4,000 in Houston. Austin, Aldrete said, is ""kind of middle of the pack."" Aldrete said it doesn’t fold in revenue-related debts because those are absorbed by rate payers, not the city. The firm’s Austin report says it raised its rating of Austin’s debt to ""AAA"" in 2008 ""based on the likelihood that the city's employment base and fiscal policies should allow it to maintain its strong financial condition even during economic fluctuations such as the current recession."" Our take? Taking into account all debts linked to the city, including revenue-backed debt, Austin didn’t rank first among Texas cities. And by a fairer comparison--focused on debts funded from property taxes--Austin landed way short of tops in Texas. Also, the statement’s laying of responsibility for the debt ranking on a single council member is unsupported.

206,pomt-04892,Says Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years.,pants on fire!,/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/06/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-anonymous-source-told-him-mitt-rom/,"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney’s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn’t paid any taxes for 10 years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, ""His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,"" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, ""Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years."" Reid continued, ""He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,"" said Reid. ""But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? … You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars."" On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, ""As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not."" And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, ""I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years."" Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. ""Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,"" Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, ""Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign."" Other Republicans leaped to Romney’s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN’s State of the Union that ""I think he’s lying"") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a ""dirty liar"" on ABC’s This Week. Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times’ Frank Bruni called Reid’s charges part of an ""unbecoming, corrosive game."" ""Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,"" Bruni wrote. ""Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That’s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late."" Many readers asked us to put Reid’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. An anonymous source? On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn’t pay taxes for 10 years. In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. But Romney’s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he’s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it’s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it’s safe to assume it’s well below 7.5 percent. Neither study directly addresses Romney’s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it’s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, ""probably not."" The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it’s ""highly unlikely"" that he paid nothing. ""It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn’t taxed until sold and may never be sold,"" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, ""But Romney’s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It’s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said."" Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it’s theoretically possible, it’s also ""preposterous."" ""Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,"" the article said. ""But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney."" We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. ""I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,"" White said. Our ruling Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that ""the word is out"" when in fact it was only Reid who put that ""word"" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up. Pants on Fire!",None,Harry Reid,None,None,None,2012-08-06T15:43:15,2012-07-31,['None']
207,pomt-00737,"""We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein, I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries.""",true,/florida/statements/2015/apr/21/jeb-bush/does-united-states-spend-more-student-most-countri/,"While some conservative activists and presidential hopefuls have trashed Common Core, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush remains a supporter of the education standards. Bush’s support for Common Core could put him at odds with primary challengers should he decide to enter the race: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, opposes Common Core, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a potential candidate, once showed tacit support but later called for repeal. During an event on April 17 in New Hampshire, a Nashua resident asked Bush straight up: ""Gov. Bush: where do you stand on Common Core?"" Bush said: ""Thank you for bringing that up. If it wasn’t going to be brought up, I was going to bring it up myself."" Bush then made his case that Common Core is essentially a push for higher standards, to address concerns about student achievement in the United States. ""We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries,"" Bush said. Bush drew applause when he said ""we don’t need a federal government involved in this at all,"" and added that he supported proposed legislation to ban the feds from creating standards or curriculum. (PolitiFact has rated multiple claims from other politicians that Common Core is a ""federal takeover"" of education and found them misleading.) Here we will fact-check Bush’s claim about the national graduation rate and how much we spend per student compared to other countries. Graduation rates and per-pupil spending There are a few different ways to measure graduation rates including the federal government's cohort method, which examines how many students who enter 9th grade graduate four years later with a standard diploma. By that measurement, the national average was about 81 percent in 2012-13. (Florida is below that national average.) As for spending, Bush’s spokeswoman pointed to a 2013 Associated Press article about a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that compared per-pupil spending among 34 advanced industrialized nations. Formed in 1961, OECD sets international standards on a wide range of topics, including education spending. The most recent OECD study -- from 2014 using 2011 data -- shows that the United States spends $12,731 per student on secondary education. Four countries -- Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland -- spend more. Those same countries are also the only ones that spend more than the United States per student on primary schools. Country Secondary per-pupil spending Austria $13,607 Luxembourg $16,182 Norway $13,939 Switzerland $15,891 United States $12,731 (Bush mentioned Liechtenstein, a tiny country located between Austria and Switzerland, but that wasn’t included on the OECD list.) Pointing to the OECD data, the federal government’s National Center for Education Statistics notes that a country’s wealth is positively associated with expenditures per student. When examining expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product for all levels of education, the United States and Chile are seventh out of 32 countries. Stanford professor Eric Hanushek, an expert on economic analysis of educational issues, told PolitiFact that the OECD ranking is the best source currently available to judge differences among nations in education. However, University of Iowa education professor David Bills offered one caveat. ""What matters is not the absolute budget per se, but the proportion of that budget that is spent on instruction,"" Bills said. Traditionally the United States spends big parts of its educational budget on non-instructional items such as security -- more so than some other nations. Bush has changed how he has worded his claim about how per-student spending in the United States compares to other countries. In 2013, Bush claimed that the United States spends ""more per student than any country in the world,"" which Factcheck.org noted was inaccurate since a few countries spent more. Our ruling Bush said, ""We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein, I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries."" The national average for the graduation rate was 81 percent in 2012-13, according to one method the federal government uses to calculate the rate. Among advanced countries, the United States ranked fifth in per student spending for secondary education behind Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland. Liechtenstein wasn’t on the list, but since Bush expressed uncertainty, we think his statement is still accurate.

208,pomt-08198,On high-speed rail.,full flop,/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/23/tom-petri/tom-petri-heads-opposite-direction-high-speed-rail/,"Over 31 years in Congress, U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, a Republican from Fond du Lac, has kept a pretty low profile on controversial issues. So it was a bit of a surprise to see his name on the bottom of a Nov. 17, 2010 statement that called the Madison-Milwaukee high speed rail link a ""boondoggle"" and declared: ""This high speed rail project is a bad investment for taxpayers and our state simply cannot afford it."" Especially since Petri’s name was on an earlier letter, dated Aug. 10, 2009, about the high-speed rail effort, which said in part: ""This investment will strengthen the surrounding Midwest economies through new rail and construction jobs, while also increasing development and connectivity from rural to urban areas."" What happened in those intervening 15 months? Well, after Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle spent years working with other Midwestern states on plans for high-speed rail, the Milwaukee-Madison link was one of 13 projects selected to receive federal funding -- $810 million -- in January 2010. Then Republican Scott Walker made stopping the train a central part of this gubernatorial campaign, as did Republican candidates in Ohio and Florida. Now, Walker says Congress should allow the state to use the $810 million on roads -- though many, including Petri, say that’s unlikely. Other states -- New York, North Carolina, California and, of course, Illinois -- are clamoring for the money Wisconsin is about to take a pass on. And, the state’s Republican members of Congress are, well, circling the wagons around Walker. Thus, the November statement from Petri and U.S. Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner of Menomonee Falls and Paul Ryan of Janesville. It read: ""We support Governor-elect Walker's effort to put the brakes on the High Speed Rail budget boondoggle, which is why we introduced legislation, today, that would give states the ability to return federal funds obligated to high-speed rail projects, and instead use this money to reduce our nation’s $1.6 trillion deficit and $13.8 trillion debt."" So, it’s time again to roll out the Flip-O-Meter. Remember, we’re not passing judgment on whether the shift was good policy or even good politics. The Flip-O-Meter measures only how much an elected official’s position has changed. Petri’s position was pretty clear in that first letter, in which he joined with U.S. Rep. Jim Oberstar (D-Minn.) and announced the creation of a congressional caucus to support high speed rail, including the network that would include the Milwaukee-Madison link. That was the letter about a strengthened economy and all that rural-urban connectivity. In many ways, the letter was in line with the views of Thompson, who was a strong backer of the high-speed network as governor and chairman of the Amtrak board. In September, Thompson did his own shift and said the state instead should ask that the money go to highways. ""I was supportive of high speed trains because I believe high-speed trains has a place,"" Thompson said at the time. ""But at this day and time and the circumstances we have right now, we can't afford it."" Petri, a long-time member of the House Transportation Committee, said he was merely heeding the wishes of state leaders, first Thompson and then Doyle. ""My position was to make the strongest case I could for Wisconsin to have high speed rail,"" Petri told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""That was successful."" So, what happened since? Petri said Walker’s election indicates that sentiment has turned away from the train. And if the train is stopped here, he wants the money to go to reduce the federal deficit -- not another state’s rail project. But how do you square a statement about the project's benefits with one declaring it a ""boondoggle""? Asked about the stark difference in the two letters bearing his boss’ signature, spokesman Niel Wright said Petri didn’t write the recent letter -- it came from Sensenbrenner’s office. ""Sensenbrenner is hotter on this and more determined on this than Mr. Petri,"" Wright said. Indeed, in his interview with us, Petri sounded remarkably open to the need for a rail connection from Madison to Milwaukee and Chicago. ""It probably should be considered at some point,"" especially as Madison continues to grow, he said. Petri also noted that the train was a ""pet project"" of President Barack Obama -- and that it was highly unlikely that the president would sign legislation directing the money for road work or deficit reduction. He said Wisconsin’s money could well wind up going to another state. ""If that’s the choice,"" Petri said, ""I’d say just go ahead with it."" If so, the Flip-O-Meter will be back for the backflip. For now, we’ll say Petri has gone from a full-blown advocate for the high speed rail project to signing onto a statement that condemned the project. And that’s a Full Flop.",None,Tom Petri,None,None,None,2010-11-23T09:00:00,2010-11-17,['None']
209,pomt-07073,"In the first 24 to 36 hours of the operation in Libya, ""you saw $115 million go downrange because a Tomahawk cruise missile is a little over $1 million each.""",mostly true,/florida/statements/2011/jun/27/allen-west/allen-west-says-military-spent-115-million-first-3/,"War is hell. War is expensive. And we can attempt to quantify just how expensive it is. That's what Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West, an Army veteran who now represents part of Broward and Palm Beach counties, did in a June 20, 2011 interview on Fox News. West has been critical of the U.S. military actions in Libya launched in March. In a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article on June 23, West was quoted as saying ""We can't keep committing U.S. military to 'protect innocent civilians'; they're exhausted."" He went into more detail on Fox News in response to a question about whether President Barack Obama would have gotten authorization from Congress to launch the operation, West responded: ""Well, the thing is this. You have got to be able to explain what the mission is. And being 22 years in the United States military, we have seen three different missions being stated. First of all, we're going to protect innocent civilians. Kind of hard to do that from 30,000 feet. The next thing, we say we're going to go in and attack the military capability of (Moammar) Gadhafi. Really hard to do between the vehicles of the rebels and his vehicles. And now we want to take Moammar Gadhafi out of power. There are means by which we can restrict and constrain and kind of temper Moammar Gadhafi without coming back again and having a third combat operation. And you want to talk about the economics of this, in the first 24 to 36 hours, you saw $115 million go downrange because a Tomahawk cruise missile is a little over $1 million each."" For this Truth-O-Meter item, we wondered if West got his numbers right. How much does the Tomahawk cruise missile cost and did we spend $115 million in the first 24 to 36 hours on missiles in Libya? And what if anything can we draw from that initial cost? Navy spokeswoman Amanda Greenberg told us in a June 23 interview that a Tomahawk cruise missile costs approximately $1.1 million. During the first 24 to 36 hours, 110 were fired by Coalition forces -- the majority by the U.S, she said. That math works out to about $121 million. West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano directed us to a March 23 article in the National Journal which states: ""On the first day of strikes alone, U.S.-led forces launched 112 long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which cost about $1 million to $1.5 million apiece, from ships stationed off the Libyan coast. That totaled $112 million to $168 million. Since those first strikes, U.S. and British forces have launched at least another 12 Tomahawk missiles. The Defense Department typically buys about 200 Tomahawks a year. While the military likely can put off buying new missiles for months, it will ultimately need to boost planned procurement rates to refill its stockpile."" The tab in Libya continues to rise. That's a concern among Democrats and Republicans who have opposed the conflict that the Obama administration entered without seeking Congressional authority. Whether Obama violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution is the topic of a separate June 22, 2011 article on PolitiFact. The White House said in a report that as of June 3, the cost of the Libya operation was about $716 million. By Sept. 30, or 90 days into the conflict, that figure is expected to rise to about $1.1 billion. West's numbers about the first day and a half are clearly on target or close enough. But what do they mean? We interviewed four experts including Gordon Adams, a professor of foreign policy at American University who was associate director for national security and international affairs at the federal Office of Management and Budget in the 1990s. We also interviewed Zack Cooper, senior analyst at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic Budgetary Assessments who co-wrote a report in March about the costs of a no-fly zone in Libya published before the conflict started. Our additional experts were James Phillips, senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. None of our experts quibbled with West's numbers. But some said the cost from the first day and half doesn't shed much light on the big picture. ""His numbers are right but it doesn't mean anything,"" Adams said, because the government already bought those missiles and would ultimately use them somewhere. ""We've already got them in the inventory -- it's not a new expenditure,"" Adams said. The government won't necessarily replace each Tomahawk missile that it used in Libya, Adams said. And that initial cost ""doesn't tell you anything"" about how much will ultimately be spent because we don't know how long the operation will continue or the operational tempo. Cooper's report estimated the initial and longer-term costs of creating different types of no-fly zones. For a limited no-fly zone covering mostly northern Libya, the report estimated upfront costs between $400 and $800 million and ultimately between $1.18 and $3.4 billion over six months. ""The initial costs in these sorts of operations are typically higher in the first stages of the operations because more expensive munitions are being used and there are a high number of targets at the outset of combat operations,"" Cooper said in an e-mail. It's not helpful to compare the cost in the first day and a half in Libya to other conflicts, Cooper said. For some broader conflicts where the initial start-up time is at least multiple days and can include troops on the ground, it's harder to pinpoint the costs compared to the cost of dropping a certain number of bombs and multiplying the cost of each bomb. For other conflicts including some of the no-fly zones ""they start small and sort of build so initial costs may be relatively small but costs over time may be large."" ""I think the Libya situation is anomolous,"" Cooper said. So can we draw any meaning from the costs in Libya the first 36 hours? ""The cost of the first day or first couple of days was largely Tomahawk missiles and maybe some other munitions, but for the most part that's why it was so expensive,"" Cooper said. ""The cost in the long term of a no-fly zone is typically fuel and operational costs so the two are very different. The upfront cost of imposing a no-fly zone are typically substantially higher than the week-to-week cost of flying planes above Libyan territory."" On Fox News West said that the United States launched about $115 million worth of missiles within the first day or day and a half in Libya. That's about $6 million less than the figure we received from the Navy. And West didn't note that some of the Tomahawks were fired by U.S. allies. But still, close enough. But there are a couple of caveats -- namely, that the U.S. already had those missiles in stock, so it doesn't represent new spending. And initial costs in a military intervention are always higher, experts told us. We rate this claim Mostly True.",None,Allen West,None,None,None,2011-06-27T10:55:40,2011-06-20,['Libya']
210,pomt-05386,"The U.S. economy is ""recovering slower than Europe """,false,/virginia/statements/2012/may/07/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-us-trails-europe-economic-recov/,"Gov. Bob McDonnell recently added a new argument to his contention that President Barack Obama’s economic policies have failed. ""We’re recovering slower than Europe and other Western countries because I think our policies for jobs and energy are just anemic with this White House,"" McDonnell said in an April 21 interview on Bloomberg TV. The economic news from abroad is hardly inspiring these days: crushing Greek debt; 24 percent unemployment in Spain; Britain falling back into recession. So we wondered whether the United States’ recovery really is trailing Europe’s. We asked the governor’s office for proof of McDonnell’s European claim and asked it to identify the ""other Western countries"" he referred to. Spokeswoman Taylor Thornley sent us an email with no answers, but saying, ""Unemployment is too high. The national debt is out of control. And too many people are out of work."" So we turned to data tables. Economists told us a standard way to examine the pace of the economy is to examine growth in gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in a country. At the time McDonnell made his statement, quarterly GDP figures through the end of 2011 were the latest ones available. Tables from the European Union’s economics statistics office show the 27 countries in the European Union, on average, were growing faster than the U.S. in the first quarter of 2011 and that trends evened out in the second quarter. In the second half of last year, U.S. GDP was rising at a faster clip than Europe. In the EU, GDP rose 1.1 percent in the third quarter of 2011 and but dropped 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The U.S., saw its economic output rise 1.8 percent in the third quarter and 3 percent in the fourth quarter. Only five of 33 European nations grew faster than the U.S. in the second half of 2011: Poland, Iceland, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. Iceland is not a member of the EU. In the weeks and days before McDonnell made his statement, international organizations that track the global economy released growth projections for the U.S. and Europe for this year. Figures released on April 17 by the International Monetary Fund show that U.S. GDP in 2012 is expected to grow 2.1 percent in 2012. That’s a bit quicker than the 1.7 percent increase the U.S. saw through all of 2011. Throughout Europe, GDP grew 2 percent in 2011, but that is expected fall to 0.2 percent this year. On March 29, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international group representing three dozen developed nations, released its projections for GDP growth in the first half of 2012. ""Our forecast for the first half of 2012 points to robust growth in the United States and Canada, but much weaker activity in Europe where the outlook remains fragile,"" Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD’s chief economist said in a news release. Figures in the report show that U.S. GDP growth at the end of 2011 was outpacing the major economies in Europe -- Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom -- which were shrinking or barely growing. Through the first half of 2012, U.S. growth was expected to outpace all those European nations. Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McDonnell is off base when he asserts Europe is recovering faster than the U.S. ""The United States, while its growth has not been spectacular, it certainly is growing modestly,"" Lachman said. ""Europe has just moved into recession. The last two quarters in Europe, many of the countries, you had negative growth."" Only four European nations -- Poland, Iceland, Turkey and the Slovak Republic -- are expected to see their GDP rise at a faster clip than the U.S. this year, according to IMF data. We also looked at unemployment rates in the U.S. and the European Union. We were unable to make an exact comparison because not all European nations define unemployment the same way as the U.S. This much is clear, however: The unemployment rate in European Union Nations rose from 9.4 percent in March 2011 to 10.2 percent in March 2012. During the same two months, the U.S. rate fell from 8.9 percent to 8.2 percent. Our ruling McDonnell said the U.S. recovery is slower than Europe’s. But looking at the continent as a whole the opposite is true. U.S. economic growth gained steam during the second half of 2011 while Europe’s started to flag. This year U.S. GDP is expected to grow at a higher pace than last year while Europe’s growth, is expected to be flat. Only five outpaced the United States in economic growth during the last half of 2011. Only four are expected to outperform the U.S. this year. This information was available before the governor made his comment.

""Even after our economy recovers,"" Obama said, ""our government will still be on track to spend more money than it takes in throughout this decade and beyond. That means we’ll have to keep borrowing more from countries like China. And that means more of your tax dollars will go toward paying off the interest on all the loans we keep taking out. By the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion. Just the interest payments."" We thought we’d check whether Obama was correct that ""by the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion."" We turned to figures published by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of fiscal statistics and projections. Specifically, we looked at CBO’s analysis, published in March, of Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. In that report, CBO offered two different projections for what the interest burden would be by the end of the decade. One of the projections looks at what would happen under Obama’s proposal. The other projection is known as the ""baseline"" budget. The baseline budget estimates what needs to be spent to maintain current services. It includes the effects of inflation, and it assumes that current law will continue indefinitely. Baselines can be a useful measure, but they are not perfect. Adhering to current law requires the assumption that Congress will let a number of policies expire, including the Bush tax cuts, periodic adjustments to limit the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax and delays to scheduled Medicare reimbursement cuts to physicians. There’s no certainty that Congress and the president will follow through with these phase-outs, given the political support for them, so the baseline budget likely underestimates the size of future deficits. Despite such imperfections, we thought that both scenarios were relevant for judging the president’s statement, so we’ll offer the figures for both. We’ll also offer figures for both 2019 and 2020, since we couldn’t come up with an answer to the question of what year constitutes the ""end of this decade."" Let’s look first at the president’s budget proposal. CBO says that during 2019, net interest costs will reach $794 billion. By 2020, the number reaches $866 billion. Now, we’ll look at the baseline budget. CBO says that during 2019, net interest costs will reach $710 billion. By 2020, the number reaches $762 billion. None of these four estimates reaches $1 trillion. The closest number is off by 13 percent, and the lowest is off by 29 percent. Marc Goldwein, policy director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the president is not far off, especially given the high degree of uncertainty about what the law will be a decade from now. Other experts we spoke to said the White House had to stretch to reach the flashy $1 trillion figure. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said that ""$710 billion or $762 billion is a lot of money, but it's not ‘nearly $1 trillion.’"" The White House pointed us to a third possibility -- the interest burden in 2021. Why 2021? That’s the final year of the decadelong ""budget window."" CBO estimated interest in 2021 to be $931 billion -- closer to $1 trillion than any of our other numbers, and possibly enough to justify Obama’s wording of ""nearly $1 trillion."" Still, we think most listeners wouldn’t immediately assume the president is talking about budget windows when he says ""by the end of this decade."" Using the figures for 2019 or 2020 instead, Obama’s numbers are off by anywhere from 13 percent to 29 percent. Obama’s underlying point is still sound -- the United States will have hundreds of billions of dollars of debt on the books -- but we think the most obvious numbers fall short of ""nearly $1 trillion.""

The only differences between the two are that the opreminfo.com article omits the final two paragraphs of the Reuters story, and it also has a different headline singling out Muslim migrants. Reuters is a reputable source, and a 2017 Guardian article corroborates much of their story. But this recently posted article has a few problems. First, there's an issue of timing. The story begins with the statement, ""Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants."" The Reuters article began with those same words, but it was published in August 2017, and was referring to a message the pope put out that same month, ahead of the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees. In it, the pope reiterates an earlier address and says, ""Our shared response may be articulated by four verbs: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate."" He then goes on to describe the task of ""welcoming"" as follows: ""Once again, I want to emphasize the importance of offering migrants and refugees adequate and dignified initial accommodation … The principle of the centrality of the human person, firmly stated by my beloved predecessor, Benedict XVI, obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security … The situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees requires that they be guaranteed personal safety and access to basic services. For the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorization."" The opreminfo.com article, published July 10, 2018, refers to that message. However, it says the pope ""urged political leaders on Monday,"" even though the pope’s remarks were published nearly a year ago. Secondly, the Reuters article makes no reference to ""Muslim migrants."" Rather, it mentions that the pope called for ""broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally."" We didn’t find any reference to Muslim migrants in the pope’s message. Our ruling An article on Facebook claimed, ""Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country."" The pope discussed ensuring all migrants' ""personal safety over national security."" But this article cherry-picked a subgroup of migrants to make it seem like he was only talking about Muslims. In addition, the text of the article is copied from a 2017 Reuters article, even though it is framed as though the speech happened recently. For a partially accurate claim that takes things out of context, we rate this headline Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com",None,Bloggers,None,None,None,2018-07-12T11:56:13,2018-07-10,['Islam']
213,pomt-07645,"""2008: Unions Spent $400 Million to Elect Obama.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-said-unions-raised-400-million-obama-2008/,"An ad from the Republican National Committee says that unions that supported President Barack Obama should stop fighting a budget deal in Wisconsin. ""Obama and the union bosses are standing in the way of economic reform,"" the ad says, adding ""Stop Obama and his union bosses today."" Onscreen, the ad shows the words, ""2008: Unions Spent $400 Million to Elect Obama."" There’s no doubt that unions strongly supported Obama over Republican John McCain in the last election. But was it to the tune of $400 million? We decided to check it out. The ad cited Politico and the Wall Street Journal as its sources, so that’s where we went first. Both reported in March 2008 that liberal groups said they hoped to raise $400 million to spend in 2008. About $300 million would come from unions, and the rest from non-union advocacy groups, including MoveOn.org, ACORN and Emily’s List. So the part attributed to unions was $300 million, not $400 million. We also noticed that both the Wall Street Journal and Politico repeated the number in other news stories without attributing the information to a specific source. So we started looking around for evidence of whether the unions had succeeded at raising the hundreds of millions they said they would in March 2008. Keep in mind, the most detailed reports mentioned the number as a goal, not an amount that had already been raised. Our attempts at independent confirmation were difficult, because unions do not have to report all of their campaign spending to the Federal Election Commission, according to independent campaign finance experts. The unions do have to report direct contributions to candidates and parties and some of their independent expenditures. But they do not have to report internal communications to membership, and they don’t have to report get-out-the-vote efforts, even if the efforts are focused on heavily Democratic areas. We contacted the staff at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks campaign spending. They told us that it would be impossible to account for all union spending during the 2008 cycle; the law doesn’t require that level of disclosure. But in the data required to be reported, the center found $75 million in direct contributions from unions and union members to candidates and parties, of which over $68 million went to Democrats. It also found $86 million in outside spending by labor in the 2008 cycle, which largely benefited Democrats. It also identified an additional $52.7 million in spending from labor groups in 527 organizations, tax exempt organizations that seek to influence elections. Add it up, and you get $206.7 million. The $400 million discussed in March might have been aspirational and not actually achieved, said Eric S. Heberlig, a political scientist who studies the labor movement at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. ""The pressure to empty their coffers to help Obama out was less when they saw he was easily able to raise that amount of money elsewhere,"" he said. Indeed, Obama raised an unprecedented amount of cash on his own. Public disclosures showed he raised $745 million, compared with John McCain’s $368 million. The RNC said the unions ""spent $400 million to elect Obama."" We do want to acknowledge that independent publications have reported that number to be the case. But when we looked into the sources for that number, we found that it was the unions themselves discussing what they hoped to raise in the 2008 election. Furthermore, the reports said they wanted to raise $300 million, not $400 million, and it was a goal, not something they had yet achieved. When we looked at the public disclosures after the election, we found the unions reported $206.7 million in spending for all Democrats. It's clear that the unions raised additional money for get-out-the-vote activities, but we don't know how much more -- nor does the RNC. Finally, all that money went to support Obama and other Democrats, not just Obama alone. In short, we don't see the evidence to support that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama.

214,pomt-12553,"Says Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has said Black Lives Matter ""is a terrorist movement, a hate group and calls it, Black LIES Matter.""",true,/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/17/sheriff-david-clarke-us-senate/pro-sheriff-david-clarke-group-says-clarke-called-/,"A committee aiming to persuade the ""people’s sheriff"" to run for the U.S. Senate is raising money by highlighting the African-American’s inflammatory statements about Black Lives Matter. It’s no secret that Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a Donald Trump supporter and nationally known conservative, has harshly criticized the group. Yet, we wondered if he has gone as far as the Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate draft committee says he has. As reported by the liberal magazine Mother Jones, the committee sent a fundraising email on April 5, 2017 that suggested several reasons why Clarke would make a good senator -- starting with this one: ""Milwaukee’s conservative black Sheriff CORRECTLY says ‘BLACK LIVES MATTER’ is a terrorist movement, a hate group, and calls it ‘Black LIES Matter.’"" The committee also makes the statement on its website. Let’s look at each of the three parts. The committee Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate is not a committee authorized by Clarke, but is registered with the Federal Election Commission as an official draft campaign. It has attacked first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, for being a lesbian as part of its effort to get Clarke to run against her in 2018. Clarke has not ruled out a run, but hasn’t expressed strong interest, either, while a number of Republicans have. For her part, Baldwin has said Clarke is ""being groomed"" to challenge her, and has raised campaign funds herself off his possible candidacy. While a favorite of the right, Clarke has drawn criticism for his racial remarks as well as for his performance as sheriff as he increasingly spends time on national television and traveling the country on speaking engagements. He has also said virtually nothing about four inmate deaths in the jail he manages that are under investigation. Now to the statement about what Clarke said. ‘Hate group’ Black Lives Matter formed after a Florida jury in 2013 found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen. Describing its aim as rebuilding ""the black liberation movement,"" the group has participated around the country in demonstrations, including some around Milwaukee, about police killings of black people. Clarke called Black Lives Matter a ""hate group"" in a July 2016 opinion column he wrote for FoxNews.com and has made any number of similar references such as these: ""I wish the Southern Poverty Law Center would add them (Black Lives Matter) to the list of hate groups in America … this hateful ideology of Black Lives Matter."" -- Fox News’ ""America’s News HQ,"" July 31, 2016 ""Black Lives Matter are purveyors of hate. It is a hateful, violent ideology."" -- Fox News’ ""Hannity"" show, July 17, 2016 Black ‘Lies’ Matter Clarke has used ""Lies"" instead of ""Lives"" in referencing the group many times, including in his memoir, released in February 2017, and on CNN and Fox in 2015. In the Fox interview, he elaborated on why, saying: ""The whole thing is built on a lie, the whole premise is built on a lie. But it’s a conglomeration of misfits. You have Occupy movement, you have organized labor in on it now, you have criminals, you have black racialists, you have cop haters and anarchists have now formed together this faux movement, if you will."" ‘Terrorist movement’ Clarke hasn’t used a terrorism reference nearly as often, but he does so twice in his book: Black Lives Matter does not ""care about black lives. They care about their own radical ideology of terrorism: anarchy."" ""In the five days surrounding the Dallas shooting -- which was the worst police massacre since 9/11, by the way -- there was even more Black LIES Matter-inspired violence (four attacks on police are listed)….Let me guess. You’d never heard of these incidents. That’s because the media protect and lie about this insidious terror organization."" Clarke also predicted on Twitter in 2015 that Black Lives Matter ""will join forces with ISIS to being (sic) down our legal constituted republic."" And in a July 2016 column he wrote for The Hill, he said: ""We have several forces internal and external attacking our rule of law: ISIS, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street – just the most recent iterations of the elements who brand themselves as unique but seek the same revolutionary aim: take down the West …"" Our rating The Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate draft committee says that Clarke said Black Lives Matter ""is a terrorist movement, a hate group and calls it, Black LIES Matter."" Clarke has repeatedly used Lies instead of Lives in labeling the group, and has repeatedly called it a hate group. In his memoir, he calls the group a ""terrorist organization.""

215,pomt-00075,"""The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country. And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote.""",false,/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-says-democrats-invite-migrant/,"President Donald Trump is rallying support for Republican candidates in the midterm elections with sweeping rhetoric about Democrats looking out for waves of ""illegal aliens"" over the interests of Americans. ""The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country,"" Trump said Oct. 26 at a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C. ""And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote."" A caravan of Central American migrants is in southern Mexico trekking north to the Mexico-U.S. border. Some are fleeing gangs in Central America and plan to request asylum in the United States. Others say they are migrating due to poverty in their home countries. (Here’s what we know about the caravan, and here’s a round-up of misinformation about it.) The White House did not provide an on-the-record response to back Trump’s claim. Democrats have said immigrants should be allowed the legal right to ask for asylum, but that’s not the same as inviting caravans to come to the United States. They also haven’t said they want to ""sign them up"" for benefits or to vote illegally, or to go beyond existing laws. No Democratic invitation for caravans Democrats have largely remained silent about the caravan, focusing instead on Republicans and health care as the Nov. 6 Election Day nears. Some Democrats have said that immigrants seeking asylum should be allowed to go through that legal process, but that’s not necessarily extending an invitation. CNN’s Jake Tapper in an Oct. 23 interview asked Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to address the Democratic Party’s message about the caravan and whether they’d be allowed to ""come in and apply for refugee status."" ""We are a nation of laws, and the laws that are on the books deal with issues of refugee and asylum status, and those are the laws that have always applied,"" Perez said. ""It's a humanitarian issue of significance, and our laws require that people be treated with dignity and given that process."" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., made a similar statement. ""Our strength has always been that we are a tolerant country, that we are welcoming in particular those who have fled harm,"" Harris said Oct. 22 in Iowa, according to CNN. ""The idea that we're vilifying any one group, and the fear-mongering — that's not in the best interest of our country."" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in an Oct. 20 joint statement said Trump was ""desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about,"" adding that Republicans ""are making a mess of our health care system."" Pelosi reiterated that message in another statement: ""Despite Republicans’ fear-mongering, this group of families may not even make it to the U.S. border, and those migrating for economic reasons will not qualify for asylum."" Caravan members are also not ""illegal aliens,"" said Stephen Legomsky, a professor emeritus at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration. ""Of course the U.S. isn’t obligated to grant asylum to everyone who applies,"" said Legomsky, ""but upon reaching the border they have a legal right, explicitly granted by Congress, to apply for it."" ""Sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote"" Democrats aren’t saying they want to sign up caravan members for perks upon arrival, much less the right to vote without being U.S. citizens. PolitiFact has repeatedly debunked Trump’s claims of mass voter fraud. Even if some caravan members were granted asylum and became citizens, it would take several years before they are able to vote for candidates for federal office. (A small number of jurisdictions allow noncitizens to vote in local races.) ""The only caravan members who might one day become eligible to vote would be those who are found to meet all the legal requirements for asylum, later acquire green cards, and then eventually become naturalized citizens,"" Legomsky said. A person must be a green card holder for at least five years and meet certain other requirement before applying for U.S. citizenship. If granted asylum, immigrants do become eligible for Medicaid and other forms of government assistance, Legomsky said. Federal law bars immigrants in the country illegally from most public assistance programs. However, they can receive free school lunches, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and emergency medical care. ""Concern over illegal immigrants placing significant demands on public service is well founded,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration levels. ""But it is not some moral defect on their part, rather it reflects the very low education levels of this population and resulting low income and them needing services."" A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case also said that immigrants, regardless of immigration status, are allowed free elementary and secondary education. ""But immigrant children can’t access that right if they are detained waiting for their asylum hearings, except in a few family detention centers,"" said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. If caravan members get into the United States and receive emergency medical care, go to public school and get free school lunch, it wouldn’t necessarily be because Democrats ""sign them up,"" it would be because it’s permitted under law. If they eventually obtain U.S. citizenship, they’d be allowed to vote. Our ruling Trump said, ""The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country. And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote."" A top Democrat said immigrants should be allowed go through the asylum application process, which is available under law. But it’s a stretch for Trump to say that’s an invitation for caravans to come to the United States. Immigrants granted asylum become eligible for Medicaid and other forms of government assistance. Immigrants in the country illegally can receive emergency medical care and limited access to programs, such as free school lunch and free public education. That wouldn’t be because Democrats ""want to sign them up,"" but because it’s allowed by law. Trump’s claim also falsely implies Democrats want to rush caravan members in to vote in the midterm elections. Trump’s claim is inaccurate and a distortion of the facts. We rate it False.

216,pomt-05586,"Says Barack Obama's health care law ""will be the biggest job-killer ever.""",false,/florida/statements/2012/apr/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-calls-health-care-law-job-killer/,"As Supreme Court justices embarked on three days of oral arguments in the historic lawsuit over the health care law, Gov. Rick Scott went on a national TV media blitz and said one of the most regurgitated falsehoods of the health care debate. ""I ran on a campaign of getting our state back to work. This will be the biggest job-killer ever,"" he said on Fox and Friends on March 26, 2012. ""I mean, think about it, the government can’t buy health care cheaper than anybody else can. And we have these unbelievable penalties, which will have to go up."" ""It will be a big job-killer because it will cost too much,"" he said. PolitiFact has examined similar claims about the law’s job-killing effect from House Republican Leader Eric Cantor, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and former U.S. Senate candidate and former Florida House Majority Leader Adam Hasner. None fared well on our Truth-O-Meter. We wanted to rule on Scott’s statement given renewed debate on the law. We’ll explain how we examined the ""job-killing"" rhetoric in the past before getting around to Scott specifically. None of the folks who made the claim before now could back it up with valid projections of job losses, and instead presented partisan reports or skewed interpretations of independent reports as evidence. One Republican document, ""Obamacare: A Budget-Busting, Job-Killing Health Care Law,"" claimed ""independent analyses have determined that the health care law will cause significant job losses for the U.S. economy."" It cites a 2010 report by the CBO, which analyzes the impact of legislation, that allegedly determined the law would lead to roughly 650,000 lost jobs. But the report didn’t say that. It said the reduction in the amount of labor in the economy would be ""roughly half a percent"" -- and not because of onerous regulation. Some workers around retirement age may decide to stop working earlier than they planned, the report states, pointing to the affordability of insurance to be offered outside of the workplace. The same report says the law may also mean more people seek jobs because of a Medicaid expansion that allows more low-income people to work and still qualify for the program. The CBO does highlight a part of the law that will likely lead to lost jobs: the requirement that businesses with 50 or more workers pay a fee if they do not offer health insurance (or if the plan they offer falls short on some criteria and at least one employee receives a subsidy from the to-be-created insurance exchange). This fee, CBO states, will be passed on to employees through reduced wages and other compensation. Because some businesses pay a chunk of employees at minimum wage, it’s inevitable that some will take on fewer low-wage workers. They may also respond by hiring more part-time or seasonal employees. That’s as specific as it gets in the CBO’s update. Why? Because it will take time to assess the effects of the law, most parts of which won’t be implemented for another couple of years. Another source the Republicans have used for backup is pretty irrelevant now. The National Association of Independent Business said in a 2009 report the impact of a provision requiring businesses to offer insurance would lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs, two-thirds of which would be from small business. But the blanket employer mandate did not make it into the final law, which exempts companies with 50 or fewer employees from any mandate. The NFIB produced a more recent study in November 2011 blasting another part of the law: an escalating annual fee (starting in 2014) on the health insurance sector that the group says will be passed on to businesses through increased premiums. This requirement, which the lobbying group calls a health insurance tax, would lead to lost private-sector jobs between 125,000 and 249,000 in 2010, the group said. Job losses would total 4,700 through 2021 in Florida. We’ve found a few problems with NFIB research in our past stories. For starters, it’s not really independent in the ideological sense. The lobbying group opposes policy that places a financial burden on business and sued against the health care law at the Supreme Court. In other words, it’s not exactly our go-to source for objectivity. Still, we dug into the substance of their claim that the law will cost hundreds of thousands of private jobs in our most recent check of this job-killing claim. Several skeptical experts told us the impact would not be that big, pointing out that employer payments under the law are small, and that the NFIB’s research doesn’t factor in new tax credits under the law for small businesses, which would actually lead to savings in premium contributions. ""The rhetorical hysteria explicit in the term ‘job killer’ is enough to make one despair for rational public debate,"" said Henry Aaron, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in a February email with PolitiFact. Like CBO, we’ve cautioned that a discussion of what the law will or won’t do is mostly based on speculation. Even when parts of the law go into effect in 2014 (barring Supreme Court action), we won’t know if it has a drastic effect on jobs until the years that follow. Our friends at FactCheck.org arrived at the same conclusions we did about the job-killing threat in January 2011. So what about Scott? Could he cite new, compelling evidence for this well-worn claim? ""It’s a prediction based on conversations with business owners and other job creators,"" spokesman Brian Burgess wrote in an email. He didn’t elaborate. Analyzing the truthfulness of predictions is tricky business in which we normally prefer not to delve. But the job-killing claim is widely spread, and does not carry proof. Scott’s spokesman said this is a prediction based on anecdotal conversations with business owners. We say it’s not one steeped in credible, independent evidence -- it’s more like a scare tactic. We rule this claim False.",None,Rick Scott,None,None,None,2012-04-02T11:42:20,2012-03-26,['None']

Most didn't dispute that fact, saying it was a necessary anti-fraud measure. We previously rated as True a claim from Milwaukee Ald. Milele Coggs that ""In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation."" Republicans did, however, make several changes that put in doubt whether it's still the most restrictive, or just one of the most restrictive. But in the weeks before the state Assembly approved the amended measure May 11, at least one photo ID backer in the state Senate put Wisconsin’s status in a totally different light. (The Senate was poised to give final approval to the bill on May 19, 2011.) State Sen. Terry Moulton, R-Chippewa Falls, answered constituent concerns with a letter that made this claim: ""Wisconsin is one of the few states in the country that do not currently require a photographic identification."" We heard from two Moulton constituents -- Gail Halmstad of Chippewa Falls and Jim Dunning of Eau Claire -- who said they received those Moulton letters between late March and mid-April. Both said they question the need for a photo ID mandate at the polls. Others, including state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, have made similar statements. ""I think most people just want to get the issue off the table and say, yeah, we should have an ID in order to vote. Most states have an ID for voting,"" Darling told a WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) reporter for a May 11, 2011 story. Darling didn’t say ""photo"" ID, so her statement can’t be equated with that of Moulton. But that’s what the bill requires and what she supports, so her comment may have left the impression with viewers that she meant most states have photo ID for voting. Moulton’s statement was simple and straightforward. So is our evaluation, since we have been down this road before. The definitive source for up-to-date information on state-by-state requirements for voter identification is the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures’ online guide, ""Voter Identification Requirements."" So is it true that Wisconsin is one of the few states that lacks a photo ID rule for voting? Actually, it’s the opposite. Only eight states currently request or require a photo ID to vote, according to the group. A ninth state, Kansas, will require photo ID as of 2012, we found. (The Wisconsin law would take effect in 2012 as well, barring a court injunction.) Another 18 states require some form of identification, but it does not have to include a picture. That tally will move to 19 in July 2011 when Oklahoma election officials begin requesting photo ID, according to the group. These numbers could change more in the months ahead. According to Brennan Center for Justice research, 37 states including Wisconsin are considering or have considered voter ID and/or proof of citizenship legislation in recent months. But currently Wisconsin is in a very large group of states that do not require photo ID to vote -- not ""one of the few"" who do not. Most states do not ask or mandate photo ID. Moulton’s office told us they inadvertently erred in the constituent letter and have omitted the claim in letters that have gone out recently. Elise Nelson, an aide to Moulton, gave us a copy of the revised letter she said went out on May 10, and it does not include the earlier claim. But it does not correct it either, so recipients may still have the impression the earlier claim is fact. Nelson said she did not know where Moulton’s office came up with the original claim. The bottom line? As Wisconsin was on the verge of enacting a photo ID requirement for voting, Moulton said the state was one of only a few without one. But as senators prepared to cast their final vote, most states still do not require photo ID to vote. Moulton’s claim to constituents, as his office notes, was well off target.

Sean Duffy, R-Wis., alluded to secretly recorded videos that prompted the legislation, then he made a claim about the group’s political activity. ""If you watch this debate, you have to ask: How could anybody defend the practices at Planned Parenthood?"" Duffy said on the House floor on Sept. 18, 2015, the day the House approved the one-year defunding. ""Harvesting body parts. How could anybody defend that? It’s an easy answer. Look in (the) political season. Millions of dollars, millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and to the Senate. This isn’t about babies; this is about money."" A reader asked us to check Duffy’s claim. The videos, the funding The videos, first released in July 2015, show Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress, which recorded the videos, alleges Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. But Planned Parenthood says it has done nothing illegal, and that the videos were edited in a misleading way. The defunding bill, which has yet to be taken up by the U.S. Senate, would end federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, diverting the money to thousands of community health centers. Republicans say those clinics could handle the displaced Planned Parenthood patients, but Democrats say the centers are overburdened and sometimes in remote locations. Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million each year in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients. That's around one-third of the organization's $1.3 billion annual budget. As for Planned Parenthood’s political activity, some of this ground was covered when Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina made a similar claim. She said Planned Parenthood ""funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates."" PolitiFact National rated the statement Mostly True. Millions have been spent. But the caveat is that the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics -- separate entities that are affiliated with Planned Parenthood can. Duffy’s claim Duffy’s claim was a little different -- that Planned Parenthood spent millions to elect Democrats to the House and Senate. We found, using figures from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, that that was this case. In the 2014 election cycle alone, Planned Parenthood-affiliated groups that can't give directly to candidates or coordinate with them, such as Planned Parenthood Votes, a Super PAC, made over $6 million in independent expenditures. That included $1.85 million spent in support of Democrats and $2.87 million spent against Republicans. ""In addition, Planned Parenthood's PAC gave nearly $590,000 to congressional candidates, all of them Democrats."" The numbers would be higher, of course, if previous cycles were included. Our rating Duffy said: ""Millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and the Senate."" By law, the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics.

219,pomt-01308,"""We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise"" in the Miami area and ""hundreds of millions of dollars to deal with coral reefs.""",mostly false,/florida/statements/2014/oct/29/rick-scott/florida-spending-350-million-deal-sea-level-rise/,"Gov. Rick Scott has drawn criticism from environmentalists for denying in 2011 that man contributes to climate change and now dodging questions with the reply of ""I’m not a scientist."" The topic arose during the Oct. 21 CNN debate when moderator Jake Tapper asked Gov. Rick Scott why he was ""reluctant to believe the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that man contributes to climate change."" Instead of answering the question directly, Scott claimed that he had already taken action to protect the environment, including addressing sea-level rise. ""We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise down in the Keys, or down in the Miami area. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars to deal with coral reefs,"" he said. Scott made a similar claim in the debate at Broward College on Oct. 15. Scott’s claim, particularly about investing in projects to combat sea-level rise, stood out for us. Under Scott, has the state spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise in the Miami area and hundreds of millions to protect coral reefs? Did Scott invest hundreds of millions to help coral reefs? We asked a Scott campaign spokeswoman to provide details about the spending for both projects. As for the coral reefs, Jackie Schutz told PolitiFact that the state had ""$100 million spent on protecting the Keys."" The money stemmed from a mandate by the state for the Keys to upgrade from cesspits and septic tanks to a modern sewer system. Improving water quality can help coral reefs. In 1999 when Jeb Bush was governor, the state required that the Keys comply with wastewater standards that would necessitate modern sewer by 2010. That deadline would later be extended to 2015. To meet that goal, when Charlie Crist, was governor the Legislature approved a bill in 2008 that allowed bonding of $50 million a year for four years for the wastewater program. The bill stated that ""beginning July 1, 2010, the Legislature shall analyze the ratio of the state's debt to projected revenues prior to the authorization to issue any bonds under this section."" No money was actually doled out during the Crist administration, which coincided with the recession. Scott took over as governor in 2011. The first year that the state doled out money was in 2012. But the next year Scott, along with legislative leaders, decided not to issue bonds due to concerns about the state’s debt capacity, according to an article in the Florida Keys Keynoter. In 2014, the state doled out the second $50 million. In August 2014, Scott’s campaign released a ""Let’s Keep Florida Beautiful Plan,"" which included a promise to invest another $100 million in the Keys wastewater project. So how does the sewer system relate to coral reefs? Centralized wastewater treatment prevents nutrients and other pollutants from entering nearshore waters, said Chris Bergh of The Nature Conservancy in the Keys. Wastewater treatment kills bacteria from human waste that can cause coral disease. ""It was a great boon to the Keys environment and residents, but it will not affect sea-level rise in any but the most tangential ways,"" Bergh said. Sea-level rise money A spokesman for Scott’s office, John Tupps, sent us a list of what he said amounted to over $350 million ""to address flood mitigation and sea-level rise."" The projects were administered by various state agencies and included the following, in addition to the $100 million for sewer in the Keys: • $21 million for FEMA flood map modernization; • $122 beach protection projects; • $5 million for the coastal zone management program; • $80 million for flood mitigation in Florida in coastal communities; • $25 million for the Keys wastewater revolving loan program projects. The first thing we will point out is to get to $350 million Scott counted $100 million to install a sewer system in the Keys even though the point of that project wasn’t to deal with sea-level rise. We asked environmental experts if these additional projects should be considered as steps toward combating sea-level rise. They told us that while these projects have their merits, they aren’t long-term solutions to sea-level rise. For example, better flood maps help identify properties that are vulnerable under today’s conditions to flooding, but they don’t deal with future sea-level rise, Bergh said. These are typical beach maintenance and flooding-related projects. Scott hasn’t taken steps that scientists say would address future sea-level rise such as reducing coal-fired power plants. Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton said that if the beach protection projects refer to pumping sand onto the beach, that is an ""ineffective short-term temporary fix."" Chanton was one of the scientists who met with Scott this summer and urged him to take action on climate change. The scientists showed Scott how two feet of sea-level rise -- projected by 2048 -- will swallow much of Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. They called on Scott to reduce or eliminate coal-fired power plants; wean the state off carbon-emitting natural gas and oil-fired power; and develop more alternative energy options. The scientists noted that sea-level rise has already caused flooding in Miami Beach at high tide. We also sought out several government officials in Broward and Miami-Dade counties as well as the cities of Miami and Miami Beach to see if they had received state money to combat sea-level rise. No one could pinpoint a specific project. ""I have no idea what he's talking about. It's the first I've heard of it,"" said Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers, who serves on the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, in an interview with the Florida Keys Keynoter. Our ruling Scott said during the CNN debate, ""We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise"" in the Miami area and ""hundreds of millions dollars to deal with coral reefs."" The state has spent $100 million to help the Keys upgrade to a sewer system, which should improve water quality -- a benefit for coral reefs. Scott omits that it was under Crist that the Legislature passed a law paving the way for the money, and he's wrong to claim it's ""hundreds of millions."" Scott’s office also pointed to a list of projects including flood mitigation, flood maps and beach protection -- and throws in the $100 million for the sewer project -- to make his claim about $350 million to deal with sea-level rise. While these include worthy projects, experts say they aren't directly related to addressing future sea-level rise. They’re typical projects for Florida, not new measures to address climate change. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b018571a-a6da-4df3-bb12-dc2a0e1f93ed",None,Rick Scott,None,None,None,2014-10-29T14:38:50,2014-10-21,['Miami']
220,pomt-08459,"John Raese's wife ""is registered to vote in Florida so she can't even vote for him.""",true,/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/14/joe-manchin/joe-manchin-attacks-john-raese-wife-registered-vot/,"In what's becoming a familiar story, a longtime public official is facing a significant threat from an upstart challenger. In this case, the race is for the U.S. Senate seat for West Virginia formerly held by the late Robert Byrd, a Democrat. Gov. Joe Manchin, also a Democrat, was considered the favorite, but John Raese, a Republican businessman, has been showing strength in the polls. So Manchin recently released a harsh attack ad against Raese. Here's how it goes: ""John Raese thinks we're hicks. His people hired actors from Philadelphia to attack Joe Manchin and told them to dress 'hicky.' It's insulting and he didn't even apologize. Then there's the fact Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes. Obviously, we're not good enough for him. Raese's wife is registered to vote in Florida so she can't even vote for him. Why should we?"" There's a lot to unpack there. Let's start with the ""hicky"" charge before moving onto our fact-check. The ""hicky"" incident arose from an attack ad against Manchin that the National Republican Senatorial Committee put together. The ad shows three men in a diner talking about how they don't want to vote for Manchin because he would support President Barack Obama. The men are wearing flannel shirts and trucker hats, but other than that, it seems like a straightforward ""man on the street"" type of ad. The controversy came when Politico reported on the advertisement looking for actors in Philadelphia to portray the men at the diner. ""We are going for a 'Hicky' Blue Collar look,"" read the casting call for the ad. ""These characters are from West Virginia so think coal miner/trucker looks."" ""Clothing Suggestions"" included jeans, work boots, flannel shirt, denim shirt, ""Dickie's type jacket with t-shirt underneath,"" down-filled vest, ""John Deer [sic] hats (not brand new, preferably beat up),"" ""trucker hats (not brand new, preferably beat up),"" according to Politico. Several days after those descriptions came to light, the NRSC fired the firm that was responsible. We weren't as interested in the 'hicky' controversy as we were in the claims about Raese's Florida connections. We asked the Raese campaign for a response, but we didn't hear back. So we started by checking the voter registration rolls in Florida, which are public records. We quickly determined that Raese's wife, Elizabeth Raese, is registered to vote in Palm Beach County. She has been registered since 2001 and last voted in the 2008 election, according to the Palm Beach County Supervisor of elections. We also cross-checked her address with the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser. Property records indicate Elizabeth and John Raese own a 6,934 square foot home purchased in 1999 and with a market value of $2.67 million. The 2010 record also shows that the Raese's receive a homestead exemption, which indicates that the home is an owner's primary residence. We spoke with officials at the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser's office. They confirmed that the Raese's did qualify for the exemption for the 2010 tax year, and that Elizabeth Raese is registered to vote in Florida and holds a Florida driver's license. John Raese is listed as ""owner non-resident"" in the appraiser's records. The officials confirmed that it's possible for a married couple to jointly own property and claim an exemption when only one spouse is the Florida homeowner. It might seem strange to have a spouse who is an official resident of a state different from your own, but the Raese's wealth may account for the arrangement. Raese's campaign biography states, ""Despite a long list of business accomplishments throughout a lifetime, John is most proud of his family – wife Liz and two wonderful daughters Jane and Agnes. Liz is the founder of the Conservative Women of West Virginia, a growing group of activists charting a conservative path for the Mountain State."" (Press reports indicate his children attend a private Christian school in Florida.) The ad further states that ""Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes."" Florida does not have a personal income tax and West Virginia does, but this claim is impossible for us to check: Tax information is confidential unless a candidate chooses to release it. Raese hasn't done that. But a campaign spokesman told the Charleston Gazette that Raese does pay taxes in West Virginia. ""John Raese is a West Virginia resident. Period. He pays income and property taxes there, and any attempts to claim otherwise are acts of desperation by a hopelessly listing campaign,"" said spokesman Kevin McLaughlin. The Gazette also reported that Raese owns a home in Morgantown, W. Va., listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and that he is registered to vote in Monongalia County. Raese has run for office before and had his residency questioned by opponents. But Raese's campaign biography and independent press reports indicate that he is a longtime West Virginia resident. He serves as president and CEO of Greer Industries, a steel and limestone company founded by his grandparents and headquartered in Morgantown, W. Va. Manchin's ad tries to make voters question Raese's loyalty to West Virginia. It's hard to make a case that Raese isn't someone with longtime ties to West Virginia. On the other hand, it's true that his wife is registered to vote in Florida, and that's the fact we're checking here. Public records confirm she is registered to vote in Florida and receives a homestead exemption on her property. So we rate Manchin's statement True.",None,Joe Manchin,None,None,None,2010-10-14T17:29:35,2010-10-08,['None']
